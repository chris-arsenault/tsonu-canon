# Tsonu Canon

Tsonu Canon is an executable lore corpus and an example of tool-assisted LLM
context. Several game worlds share one Ruby DSL, one schema system, and one set
of query and validation tools. An unfamiliar model can discover a world's
vocabulary at run time, ask for the part relevant to its task, and check its
work without fine-tuning or placing the whole corpus in its prompt.

| World | Status | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [The Glass Frontier](worlds/glass-frontier/) | active | The Kaleidos system: a shattered orbital ring, its parent planet, and the surrounding solar system. |
| [The Ice Remembers](worlds/ice-remembers/) | scaffold | Aurora Berg: a continent-sized iceberg shared by three peoples who cannot leave it. |
| [The Dry War](worlds/dry-war/) | active | Earth in 2090, where mycelial and machine intelligences govern most survivors and compete for the same water. |

## Why a DSL

A Markdown wiki is a good reading target, but its usual source model is pages
and links. Lorecraft keeps the readable prose and adds structure an agent can
query and the repository can reject when it is wrong:

- entity kinds and subkinds distinguish a person, place, faction, event, and
  general concept;
- typed fact fields distinguish text, dates, numbers, and entity references;
- named relationship types can constrain their source, target, cardinality, and
  lifetime;
- a shared timeline computes historical state and elapsed spans;
- player and DM audiences have a checked boundary;
- controlled tags, section names, status values, and provenance declarations
  turn convention errors into validation errors;
- references resolve, transcluded passages have one owner, and generated views
  cannot silently become a second source of truth.

The result is useful to an LLM because effective context is not only the number
of tokens it can receive. It is also whether the model can find the right facts,
follow non-linear connections, exclude unrelated or private material, and get
specific feedback before a mistake enters the corpus. Lorecraft exposes those
operations as small commands instead of asking the model to ingest a directory
of pages and decide which copies or links are authoritative.

This does not make prose automatically true or good. Some entity attributes are
deliberately extensible, and validators cannot replace source reading or human
review. The schema prevents specific structural mistakes; the craft guidance
and review process govern the writing.

## Just-in-time context

The command help is part of the interface. Start with the overview, then load
only the topic or world slice the task needs:

```sh
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft help
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft help model
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft help workflow

ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft worlds
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft guide world --world dry-war
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft search "water" --world dry-war --audience player
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft schema relation governs --world dry-war
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft guide method --world dry-war
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft queue inez_bell --world dry-war
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft page inez_bell --world dry-war --audience player
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft connections inez_bell --world dry-war --audience player
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft connections inez_bell --world dry-war --format json
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft path inez_bell continuity --world dry-war
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft timeline inez_bell --world dry-war
ruby lorecraft/bin/lorecraft facts inez_bell --world dry-war
make check WORLD=dry-war
```

`search` finds the stable id and canonical source for a subject. `guide` reads
one current craft or world instruction file without duplicating it in the CLI.
`schema` reports the kinds, facts, relations, tags, and sections the selected
world will enforce. `page` answers “what does a reader see?”, `connections`
exposes its typed neighborhood and source files, and `path` connects two known
ids when their route matters. `timeline` answers “what changed this entity?”,
`facts` answers “which declared fields are missing?”, and `queue` answers “what
needs attention?”. `topology` and `web` expose broader graph shape only when the
task needs it. Commands whose help lists `--format` can return native JSON; the
others intentionally remain human-readable. This progressive path reduces
context poisoning: generated indexes, old reports, unrelated entries, and
DM-only material do not enter an edit merely because they share a directory or
search term.

See [the Lorecraft guide](lorecraft/README.md) for authoring and every command,
[the language reference](docs/lorecraft-spec.md) for the current DSL, and
[the architecture](SYSTEM.md) for loading, rendering, and deployment. The
[composition and editorial metadata guide](docs/canonical-composition.md)
describes transclusion, computed time, questions, logs, and provenance.
Use the [local review app](tools/review-app/README.md) for revision-checked
source updates during interactive review.

## Repository boundaries

```text
worlds/<id>/world/     canonical entities, prose, moments, and relationships
worlds/<id>/guidance/  setting-specific vocabulary and writing constraints
craft/                 rules and schema shared by every world
lorecraft/             loader, query model, validators, help, and renderers
tools/review-app/      trusted loopback editor for review declarations
apps/web/              public multi-world reader
backend/editorial-api/ read-only authenticated access to generated editorial records
```

The DSL under `worlds/<id>/world/` is the only canonical lore. Public reader
JSON, private editorial JSON, graph JSON, Markdown trees, and wiki pages are
generated views.

## Build and verify

```sh
make worlds                        # list active and scaffold worlds
make check WORLD=glass-frontier    # validate and lint one world
make check-all                     # validate and lint every active world
make test                          # Lorecraft unit tests
make review-check                  # local review server tests and client build
make site-data                     # public reader and private editorial JSON
make reader-build                  # production React build
make wiki WORLD=glass-frontier     # optional GitHub wiki export
make app-check                     # content, Rust, TypeScript, and Terraform checks
```

Lorecraft and the review writer require Ruby 3.3+; the web tools require Node 24
and pnpm 10. The editorial API requires a current Rust toolchain. Run
`npm ci` under `tools/review-app/` before `make review-check` or local review.
`pnpm --dir apps/web dev` rebuilds lore data and starts the reader at
`http://localhost:5173`.

CI runs the Lorecraft and local review-app tests, checks every active world,
builds the review client and reader data, and then delegates application build
and deployment to the Ahara workflow. The production reader is `canon.tsonu.com`;
the local review writer is not deployed. The wiki renderer remains an optional
export and is not deployed by this repository.

Known unfinished work is in [docs/backlog.md](docs/backlog.md); completed
checkpoints and local publication state are in [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md).
