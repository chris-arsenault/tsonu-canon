# Voice & Register Review Prompt

Run this against any lore file to check for voice violations. Pass the file content and this prompt to an LLM, together with the world's `guidance/voice-referents.md` — that file lists the referents this particular setting bans and what to reach for instead.

## Prompt

You are reviewing a lore encyclopedia entry for a secondary-world fiction setting. The entry should read as if written by a chronicler who lives in this world. It should never acknowledge that it is fiction, a game, a wiki, or a designed artifact.

Review the following entry and flag every instance of these problems:

### 1. Domain leakage
References to real-world Earth concepts used as comparisons or descriptions. The world has no Earth — no place names, no brands, no institutions, no technologies that exist only here. When the prose says "like calling a cab" or "Venus-like" or "the equivalent of owning a sailboat," it has broken the fourth wall. The world's `guidance/voice-referents.md` lists the specific leaks that setting has had before, and the in-world substitutions for them.

**Not** domain leakage: using universal physical concepts (gravity, pressure, crystalline), general English words that aren't Earth-specific (city, river, war, trade), or in-world analogies (comparing one in-world thing to another).

### 2. Wrong register
Prose that reads like design notes, author commentary, or game documentation rather than an encyclopedia entry. Examples:
- "This will likely become its own entry" (authoring process)
- "A candidate for one of the undefined culture slots" (design language)
- "There is no DM answer here" (game terminology)
- "Everything this wiki is mostly about" (self-referential)
- "Not yet defined" (acknowledging incompleteness as a design state rather than an in-world gap in knowledge)

Encyclopedia entries can acknowledge gaps in knowledge — "the cause remains unknown" is fine. What's wrong is acknowledging gaps in *authoring* — "this hasn't been written yet."

### 3. Author's notes leaked into prose
Content that was clearly a note from the author to themselves (or to a collaborator) that ended up in the published text. Things like explaining what a concept is *for* in the setting rather than what it *is* in the world. Descriptions of narrative function rather than in-world reality.

### 4. Coy uncertainty
Claims such as “nobody knows,” “nobody understands,” or rhetorical questions that announce mystery without identifying the evidence boundary. The replacement should preserve the unknown while stating what instruments show, what witnesses disagree about, and who holds which explanation. Flag a run of "does not establish" or "records omit" sentences under this heading too.

### 5. Narrator's verdict
A quip, moral, interpretation, or forecast added after the facts: “neither sees the irony,” “that is what makes it dangerous,” “the argument will continue,” or “whether it holds remains to be seen.” Attribute a judgment to people in the world, replace it with an observable consequence, or remove it when it adds no information.

### 6. Reveal scaffolding
Repeated “not X, but Y,” “it does not merely,” and parallel negations that make the narrator perform a correction or reveal. State the positive claim first. Retain the contrast only when the rejected interpretation is an established in-world belief.

### Output format

For each violation found, output:
```
LINE: [approximate line or quote]
TYPE: domain-leakage | wrong-register | author-note | coy-uncertainty | narrator-verdict | reveal-scaffolding
QUOTE: "[the offending text]"
FIX: [suggested replacement; use "remove" only when the passage contains no distinct fact, uncertainty, image, viewpoint, causal link, or useful atmosphere]
```

Every fix must preserve the entry's lore. A style review does not shorten an article merely because it is long or divide it merely because it has many sections.

If the entry is clean, say so.
