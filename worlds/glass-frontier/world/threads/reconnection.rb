  log "2026-09-15 — Bounded Famine memory and communication taboos to participating communities, preserved refusal and local variation, and corrected the Accord framework's start to 2423."

  prose <<~PROSE
    *A fractured civilization remembers it was once whole — and discovers that "whole" no longer means what it used to.*

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :description, heading: "The Emotional Core"
    The Signal Famine was #{elapsed :the_glassfall, :the_rekindling} of broken long-distance contact. Communities that depended on lost supplies faced immediate danger. Others maintained local networks or self-sustaining environments. Sithari made self-sufficiency part of its civic identity. Among the communities whose survival improved with reconnection, communication acquired a lasting moral importance.

    Fear of renewed disconnection constrained fighting along the restored routes. The Hinge Six occupation demonstrated the cost of interfering with civilian messages. Participants carried that experience into the Accord, but communities outside those routes did not all acquire the same obligations or fears.

    ### Beat 1: The Severance
    **Era:** 2140 CE | **Filled by:** #{ref :the_glassfall, "The Glassfall"}

    The ring shatters. Long-distance ring communications collapse. Communities dependent on those links lose contact; coastal and other surviving local networks continue on worlds such as Korvath.

    **Effect:** Immediate infrastructure crisis.
    **Consequence:** Communities deprived of essential supplies must develop replacements or obtain help through surviving local routes.
    **Downstream:** Two divergent survival strategies emerge (Beat 2).

    ---

    ### Beat 2: The Divergence
    **Era:** 2140–2305 CE | **Filled by:** Signal Famine (era)

    Two responses to #{elapsed :the_glassfall, :the_rekindling} of isolation shaped the later reconnection:

    **Communities deprived of essential supplies** face genuine resource crisis. Many fail. Survivors develop local means of provision and traditions of mutual aid; some later establish rituals and festivals celebrating restored contact.

    **Large communities** (Sithari, others) stabilize through institutional strength. #{ref :sithari, "Sithari"} and #{ref :the_continuity, "The Continuity"} flourish precisely because they don't need anyone else. Self-sufficiency becomes identity, not just survival strategy.

    **Effect:** Separated communities develop different governments, cultures and relationships with resonance; surviving local networks retain exchanges of their own.
    **Consequence:** When they reconnect, they discover they've become strangers (Beat 5).
    **Downstream:** Fear of disconnection becomes a cultural inheritance among many participants in the restored networks (Beats 7, 8). Reconnection traditions persist locally. Sithari's self-sufficient pride becomes both strength and source of resentment.

    ---

    ### Beat 3: The First Signal
    **Era:** ~2305 CE | **Filled by:** #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"}, #{ref :hab_meridian, "Hab Meridian"}

    A salvage crew in Glasswake finds a transmitter in fallen hab wreckage. Minor repair. It talks. Hab Meridian answers.

    **Emotional beat:** Disbelief → data starts flowing → confirmation it's real → joy. Not universal — some people react with suspicion — but the dominant response is joy.
    **Effect:** Proves reconnection is possible.
    **Consequence:** Communities that hear of the exchange begin further attempts with salvaged equipment; others remain beyond the returning signals or choose not to answer.
    **Downstream:** Glasswake becomes historically famous and practically unremarkable (Beat 9). The transmitter technology is crude — this is improvised, not restored infrastructure. Sets the baseline that the Span (Beat 4) will dramatically exceed.

    ---

    ### Beat 4: The Span
    **Era:** ~2305 CE (rediscovered) | **Filled by:** #{ref :span_nine, "Span Nine"}

    Pre-Glassfall hardline infrastructure — a luminous filament connecting #{ref :whitefoot, "Whitefoot"} to Pelhari and Threshold Station. It had been glowing in the sky for #{elapsed :the_glassfall, :the_rekindling}. Nobody understood what it was until the reconnection effort started looking up.

    **Effect:** Sithari gains real-time high-bandwidth communication with the #{ref :clarisant, "Clarisant"} and #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"}. A structural advantage nobody else can replicate.
    **Consequence:** Two-tier communication system emerges — Sithari has broadband, everyone else has improvised relays.
    **Downstream:** Communication inequality becomes a political grievance during the Contested Reach (Beat 7). The demand for Span-quality access motivates Coremark's Span replication experiment — which, combined with aggressive ringglass harvesting, causes the Bloom. The Span can't be sabotaged (intent-responsive), making it the one piece of infrastructure that's inviolable during the Reach — a symbol of both connection and inequality.

    ---

    ### Beat 5: The Shock of Difference
    **Era:** ~2310s–2330s | **Filled by:** #{ref :verathi_exchange, "Verathi Exchange"}, #{encyclopedia_ref :shuttered, "the Shuttered"}

    Surface communities reach ring habs. The cultural divergence is staggering. Communities that evolved in isolation for #{elapsed :the_glassfall, :the_rekindling} are unrecognizable. Some welcome contact — the resource-starved celebrate. Some refuse — the shuttered habs.

    Verathi answered willingly. The dispute began when Sithari's commission treated the hab as a returning district while Verathi received the visitors as foreign representatives. Reciprocal missions replaced inherited jurisdiction without closing the dock.

    **Effect:** The system discovers it is no longer one civilization.
    **Consequence:** The naive assumption that reconnection = reunion dies. What follows is negotiation between strangers, not homecoming.
    **Downstream:** The Contested Reach (Beat 7) is partly a fight between incompatible systems of governance and value, not just resource competition.

    ---

    ### Beat 6: Trade Resumes
    **Era:** ~2310s–2330s | **Filled by:** #{ref :meridian_crop_failure, "Meridian Crop Failure"}, #{encyclopedia_ref :ratters, "Ratters"}, #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"}, #{ref :vantara, "Vantara"}, #{ref :keel, "The Keel"}

    Salvage begins. Trade networks form. Vantara is founded to handle the boring essential work of logistics. The Keel is established as the primary orbital trade lane.

    Meridian's crop failure made the first restored signal materially useful. Glasswake sent living soil and varied root stock; Meridian returned tuned components. Their improvised environmental manifests became the basis for later living-cargo runs.

    **Effect:** Some participating communities become dependent on restored trade. Others retain local provision while adding exchanges.
    **Consequence:** Renewed disruption threatens communities that replaced local provision with imports. Self-sustaining communities can respond differently.
    **Downstream:** Vantara's infrastructure (beacons, waystations, rescue) becomes invisible essential service — threatening it during the Reach feels like threatening the water supply (Beat 7). Trade dependency provokes a backlash movement advocating Famine-era self-sufficiency as a virtue. The Keel's economic importance makes it worth fighting over AND worth protecting.

    ---

    ### Beat 7: The Constrained Conflict
    **Era:** 2340–2378 | **Filled by:** The Contested Reach (era), #{ref :shardfall, "Shardfall"}, #{ref :coriolis_breach, "Coriolis breach"}, #{ref :hinge_six_occupation, "Hinge Six Occupation"}

    Disputes over routes, resources and hab sovereignty run against a strong taboo on disrupting civilian communication along the reconnected routes:

    - Fighting near civilian communication infrastructure brings opposition from those who rely on it
    - Remote mining rigs are fair game — they're already disconnected
    - Vantara's trade infrastructure is treated as off-limits by unspoken agreement

    Third Arc Defense occupied Hinge Six and filtered traffic during an embargo. The station keepers shut the relay, and carriers boycotted the branch until the occupiers withdrew. Later forces could fight around a relay but did not seize its civilian message room.

    **Span downstream:** Communication inequality (from Beat 4) becomes a Contested Reach grievance. The demand for Span-quality access feeds into the Span replication attempt.

    **Trade downstream:** Communities that became trade-dependent (from Beat 6) are hit hardest when routes are disrupted. The visceral response to trade disruption is disproportionate — it feels existential because it echoes the Famine.

    **Effect:** The system fights but doesn't fragment. The network survives.
    **Consequence:** The constrained violence produces conditions for the Bloom (Coremark overreach, Span replication experiment) but also the cultural infrastructure that makes cooperation possible when the Bloom hits.
    **Downstream:** The comm hub incident produces an Accord provision. Veterans carry relationships that become the Bloom Coalition's connective tissue. The Reach's unwritten rules become the Accord's written ones.

    ---

    ### Beat 8: The Test
    **Era:** 2378–2407 | **Intersection with:** Bloom Containment thread

    The Bloom forces cooperation. The Reconnection thread's contribution: **cooperation works because the communication infrastructure survived the Contested Reach.** The Bloom Coalition can coordinate because nobody broke the network during the Reach. The fear of disconnection, which constrained the conflict, now enables the response.

    **Effect:** Proof that shared structures work — imperfectly, temporarily, but they work.
    **Downstream:** The Accord is possible because the Bloom cooperation demonstrated it.

    ---

    ### Beat 9: The Framework
    **Era:** 2423–present | **Filled by:** #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"}

    Born from exhaustion, pragmatism, and the Bloom cooperation's proof of concept. Not a government — a mediation structure. Free communication is a commitment of its participating settlements, maintained through their conduct and enforcement.

    **Downstream:** Participants value mediation partly because they remember the costs of disrupted contact. Sithari's Span access and institutional strength remain sources of disagreement; membership does not settle every dispute or erase local authority.

    ---

    ### Beat 10: The Unfinished Edge
    **Era:** Present–future | **Unfilled**

    Far-drift habs are being discovered. Some communities did not participate in the restored networks, the Contested Reach or the Bloom Coalition. Their experience of isolation differs, and their residents may welcome visitors, limit exchange or decline contact. Arriving crews cannot assume shared memories or a wish to join their institutions.

    **The open question:** What happens when the system contacts a community that doesn't value communication the way the reconnected world does? What happens when "the Famine was terrible" doesn't resonate because they never experienced it?
