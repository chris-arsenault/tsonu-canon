  prose <<~PROSE
    South Shade is a road house below #{ref :shadewell, "Shadewell"}'s southern rim, where the highland road meets the cargo lifts climbing to the Keel fields. Its sleeping rooms are cut into the cool side of a basalt ledge. A long roof shades the vehicle court, and a municipal return line carries kitchen and bath heat toward radiator frames on the empty slope above.

    Heat-road crews stop here before entering the port schedule. Highland handlers use it when bringing animals or produce to the rim. Off-world arrivals come down for an Ashvane night, then discover that “night” at South Shade follows Ashenmaw's shadow rather than the terminal clock.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "The Cool Side"
    The common room and kitchen occupy the ledge face. Sleeping chambers extend behind them along a gently descending passage. The deepest rooms have no exterior wall and remain cool through most surface cycles. They cost more when the port is busy and are reserved for children, heat injuries, and workers arriving from the low roads during an emergency.

    The vehicle court holds six roofed bays separated by stone walls. Warm machinery faces outward. Passenger doors open toward the shaded passage. Folding screens close each bay at ground level to keep cinderbacks from settling behind wheels and drive housings.

    Water enters through a public tap beside the kitchen and leaves through marked warm and hot returns. Guests wash tools in the warm trough. The hot return is sealed because a bucket poured there can push kitchen heat backward into the bath rooms.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Road and Port"
    A board in the court translates between shade periods, road departures, and Keel cargo calls. Haulers post arrival by road condition. Port agents post the lift slot. The house clerk writes the interval between them as rest, repair, or impossible. Drivers who accept an impossible turn lose access to the covered bays.

    Meals follow the thermal chain. Ovens use heat from the machine wash. Drying cabinets take the oven return. Bath water receives what remains before the line climbs toward the radiators. When one step closes, the kitchen changes its work rather than forcing the same load through a shorter path.

    Cargo stays in the vehicle court under its carrier's seal. The house stores medicines, personal equipment, and small heat-sensitive cases in a cool room beside the tap. Anything with an active field remains outside until the port sounders clear it.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "Giant-shade"
    The busiest meal begins when Ashenmaw crosses the sun. Road crews who worked the exposed morning arrive as port hands leave the rim. Market sellers set tables beneath the vehicle roof, and the common room doors remain open until direct light returns.

    Drivers trade reports about vent storms, road-softening heat, and which public tanks are enforcing herd limits. Port workers bring substitution lists for off-world parts. Highland mechanics mark local replacements directly onto the lists and argue over which modification the port will accept.

    The house keeps a quiet chamber for people arriving with heat exhaustion. It contains water, loose cooling cloth, low lamps, and no questions until the patient's speech steadies.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "The Culvert Herd"
    Handlers moving the cinderbacks from Shadewell's cargo-yard culverts have taken the two outer bays. Young animals sleep behind the screens while adults follow the damaged cold-store return beneath the road. Every pump start turns the herd back toward the port.

    South Shade has closed its hot return so the line does not add another gradient across the handlers' path. The kitchen is using stored fuel, the baths are cold, and hauler crews must clean warm machinery at the next road station.
