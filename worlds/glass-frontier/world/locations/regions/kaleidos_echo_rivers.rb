    setting: "Underground waterways moving through crystal-laced rock beneath Kaleidos, surfacing at springs, sinkholes, caves, and wet cliff faces.",

    hazards: "Long exposure brings headaches, disorientation, and drift severe enough for a listener to lose track of which remembered voice was theirs."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Beneath Kaleidos, water moves through rock saturated with crystal dust from #{elapsed :the_glassfall, approx: true} of ring debris. The waterways lift old signal-band impressions from the stone and carry them to springs, sinkholes, cave mouths, and wet cliff faces. Voices layer over one another there — mostly unintelligible, occasionally clear.

    The richest surfacing branches lie in the #{ref :sable_crescent, "Sable Crescent"}. Some settlements work beside them. Others keep their paths away. The #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"} maintains listening stations and catalogues what surfaces; the rivers repeat nothing on request and preserve no distinction between a repair order, a family call, and a voice from the day the ring broke.

  gm_note :triggered_by, "Repeating a name or playing a recovered voice back to the water changes nothing; the next fragment arrives on the river's own course."
  gm_note :complicates, "A listener who remains through a long scene develops the headaches and disorientation the Conclave records as drift."
