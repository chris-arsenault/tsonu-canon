    setting:
      "A circular service floor where Glasswake's old collection wells " \
      "meet the inner kite field, ringed by three lifting arms on " \
      "separate foundations cut off from each other by ceramic " \

      "weights on the control ropes show which arm holds hull, drive, " \
      "or catch assembly, and a dark-shuttered loft stores the catch " \

    activity:
      "Returning survey kites are washed, their impacts marked, and " \

      "repair with small cuts inside a service cover.",
    access:
      "The queue is published on the outer gate. Prismwell crews jump " \

    hazards:
      "A tired spar that returns by the wrong path holds a twist that " \

      "opened until a structural reader has seen which frame took the " \
      "load. Right now one arm and the dead bench belong to the marker " \

  prose <<~PROSE
    Three Arms Yard is a Prismwell repair shop in #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"}, built where the old collection wells meet the inner kite field. Three independent lifting arms stand around a circular service floor. They can hold the separate frames of a survey kite without forcing them into one alignment, allowing workers to inspect the joints that let a craft yield across a Glassfall stream.

    #{ref :rainline, "*Rainline*"} uses the yard. Its pale port brace was cut, fitted, and twice replaced here. The pattern hangs on the wall beside frames from less famous craft whose repairs taught the same lessons.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Three Loads, One Floor"
    Each lifting arm stands on its own ring foundation. Ceramic trenches separate the rings from the central floor and from one another. A kite can settle one frame at a time while the other arms remain slack. Colored weights on the control ropes show which arm currently carries hull, drive, or catch assembly.

    The central floor drains into a covered wash well. Shower dust, salt, and broken catch fiber fall there before workers open a joint. The water passes through stepped cloth beds descended from Glasswake's first collection wells. Recovered ringglass goes to the sorting yard; metal and ordinary grit go to separate bins.

    A high loft stores catch cloth under dark shutters. Clean fabric enters from the north stair. Used fabric comes up through the wash hoist and never crosses the clean racks before grading.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "After a Shower"
    A returning survey kite waits on the field until its residual pull settles. Yard hands then wash the leading surfaces and mark every impact before lifting the craft. Damage hidden beneath fused dust remains in place until a structural reader sees which frame took the load.

    Flexible spars are tested through a slow correction while suspended between two arms. The third arm follows without carrying weight. A sound spar bends, returns, and leaves the rings where they began. A tired spar returns by a different path or holds a small twist that will become larger in the next front.

    Marker lamps and sounders go to a dead bench along the western wall. Their records are read before the housings open. A lamp recovered from the wrong position stays in a ceramic box until its clock, field, and physical marks agree on at least one account of the flight.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "Yard Marks"
    Yard workers sign repairs with small cuts inside a service cover. The mark identifies the arm used, the reader who accepted the frame, and the well that supplied any recovered crystal. A later shop can reconstruct how the craft was held without contacting Glasswake.

    Apprentices begin in the wash well and cloth loft. They learn debris grades by hand before touching a lifting rope. Pilots waiting on a repair often work beside them, because a shower crew who refuses to clean its own catch receives little sympathy when asking for a quick turn.

    Prismwell crews receive priority during an active forecast. Independent pilots pay the posted rate and can take a wash or night watch for credit. The yard publishes the queue on its outer gate.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "The Returned Lamp"
    Three Arms Yard is holding the marker that reached Glasswake ahead of *Rainline*. Its casing carries no impact mark, and its deployment pins were worked twice. The first release matches the survey ship's rack. The second left a curved scoring around the pin as if the lamp had been mounted in a larger moving frame.

    Prismwell has assigned one arm and the dead bench to the examination. Damaged survey craft are waiting outside the gate while the returned lamp occupies space normally used for ordinary repairs.
