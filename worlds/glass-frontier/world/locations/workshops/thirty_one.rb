  prose <<~PROSE
    Thirty-One is a sealed textile room on Wash Four's dirty route. The bay number remains over its pressure door, while daily work drops the first word. Its central table rests on ceramic feet and drains into six sampling jars. Wall frames hold garments at full extension while directional lamps expose residue, repairs, and stressed fibers.

    Every job begins dry. Workers map a garment with tuned wooden paddles, chalk the strongest traces, and remove loose findings into labeled trays. Wash water enters only after the map is copied onto a fired ceramic sheet.

    Twenty-seven garments carrying the repeated voice now hang from the ceiling frames. Floor lanes remain open beneath them so workers can play the traces in order while walking the route they describe.

  gm_note :triggered_by, "Whatever falls out of a garment during the dry pass goes into a labeled tray instead of back to its owner, so a courier who wants a pocketed item returned has to name it before the wash and collect it from the tray."
