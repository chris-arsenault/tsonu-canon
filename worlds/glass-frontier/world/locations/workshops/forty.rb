  prose <<~PROSE
    Forty is Brake's largest enclosed cutting bay. Its official designation, Lot Forty, comes from the salvage grid painted across the central fragment. Two pressure doors open around a complete small vessel, and movable walls divide the interior into clean work, hot cutting, quarantine, and recovered cargo.

    Overhead rails carry tools and sealed observation cabins. Floor anchors accept hulls in almost any orientation. Orange paths keep people clear of moving wall sections and lead directly to independent shelters at both ends.

    The captured medical vessel stands outside the main doors under separate utilities. Forty has become its supply lock, records room, and clinical staging area while Brake studies the sleeping patients.

  log "2026-08-21 — Made the cutter shorthand Forty primary while retaining the salvage-grid designation Lot Forty."

  gm_note :appears, "Forty takes whatever Brake captures that cannot be opened in the clear: a hull found leaking, contaminated, or still under power is rerouted into the enclosed bay, and the crew that brought it in follows it through the pressure doors."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "The bay crew's first question about a new hull is which way up it should sit. The floor anchors accept almost any orientation, and the movable walls are then set around the vessel into clean work, hot cutting, quarantine, and recovered cargo."
  gm_note :complicates, "The room a scene starts in is not the room it ends in, because Forty's walls move. The orange floor paths stay clear of them and lead to the independent shelters at both ends rather than back to the doors people came in by."
