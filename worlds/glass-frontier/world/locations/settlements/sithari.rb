  prose <<~PROSE
    Sithari is the largest city in the Kaleidos system, with a few million people inside the city proper and more in the eastern sprawl. It stands at the equator above the ring-era research campus that survived the Glassfall with power, walls, and much of its service infrastructure intact. The settlement that formed around that complex became the system's financial and administrative center during the Rekindling.

    The city's name is commonly translated as "the place that kept going." Its old campus remains in use beneath the government halls, colleges, apartments, and transit lines of the present city. Orbital traffic descends at its eastern fields, while the Tempered Accord meets within walking distance of the offices that govern Sithari itself.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :geography, heading: "Four Parts of the City"
    The #{ref :old_campus, "Old Campus"} occupies the center. Ring-era walls pass through government buildings, colleges, clinics, apartment courts, and public squares. Modern structures rise from old foundations, and many have service doors at levels that were once open ground.

    The #{ref :underlayers, "Underlayers"} extend below those streets. Their upper levels are an inhabited district of workshops, markets, schools, and homes. Below the marked limit, active campus systems can change which corridors meet. Fixed stair shafts and resident-maintained route boards keep those neighborhoods connected to the surface.

    #{ref :accord_shore, "Accord Shore"} lies west of the old center around an artificial lake. Its inner bank contains the standing halls of the #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"}; the surrounding streets house delegates, translators, clerks, and the businesses that serve them. #{ref :keelward, "Keelward"} spreads east from the old city to the shuttle fields and freight terminals where #{ref :keel, "the Keel"} reaches the surface.

    Other residential and industrial wards fill the ridges and transit corridors between them. The older west and south streets follow the terrain. Keelward follows successive port boundaries. Central addresses often include a building's surface entrance and its lowest public approach because the two can belong to different districts.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :governance, heading: "The Continuity"
    #{embed :the_continuity, :public_profile}

    City departments operate from the Old Campus and through ward offices across Sithari. Keelward administers port work on schedules set by orbital traffic. Underlayers stewards can close a changing route before the central transport office updates its map. Accord Shore divides city services from Accord jurisdiction at the entrances to the inner compound. These local powers remain subject to city law while controlling decisions that cannot wait for an assembly session.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :governance, heading: "The Accord Seat", drafted_by: :ai
    The Accord meets at #{ref :accord_shore, "Accord Shore"}, outside the Continuity's government grounds. Member delegations control the hearing rooms, while Sithari supplies water, transit, emergency response, and the legal services around them. The arrangement gives the Accord institutional independence without removing it from the city that hosts it.

    During the Contested Reach and Bitter Reach, Sithari remained formally neutral while Continuity governments supported combatants through credit, logistics, and access to city institutions. Other settlements demanded a visible separation between the new Accord and the government whose past policy they remembered. The lake, public causeway, and separate security boundary provide it. Sitharian forms, staff, and language still shape the work conducted inside.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :economy, heading: "Economy"
    Sithari's largest trades are finance, law, certification, academic research, records, and media. A contract spanning three jurisdictions is often written, insured, translated, or litigated here. Ringglass cargo arriving in Keelward is graded and financed before it moves onward. Old Campus colleges train the clerks, engineers, and specialists who apply Sitharian standards elsewhere in the system.

    The city also makes and repairs precise instruments, household resonance devices, shuttle components, and the fittings used across its buried infrastructure. Heavy manufacturing occupies the outer wards; smaller workshops fill the Underlayers. Keelward handles the volume, the old center supplies records and judgment, and Accord Shore brings parties who need both.

    This centrality depends on other settlements accepting Sitharian institutions. A court order, cargo certificate, or financial instrument has value elsewhere only while its issuer is trusted. The Continuity invests in records, professional training, and compatible forms because each makes the city's work easier to accept and more expensive to replace.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :access, heading: "Access"
    Orbital shuttles and kites arrive through #{ref :keelward, "Keelward"}. Its surface-access spurs connect to ring habs, Keel traffic, and routes whose outer stops serve Shear crews. Freight rail and city transit leave directly from the arrival halls. Passenger movement between surface and orbit is routine enough that terminal neighborhoods schedule work and school around it.

    Sithari attempted a space elevator during the Rekindling. Funding ended before the tower rose, and the surface works were dismantled. The ringglass anchor beds remain below capped foundations at Keelward's southern freight boundary. Debate over resuming the project returns whenever shuttle capacity tightens.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :atmosphere, heading: "What It Feels Like"
    The surface city is dense, vertical, and bright. Engineered crystal facades stand beside ring-era walls too useful to remove. Plazas open around transit stations and government buildings, while older residential streets narrow around foundations that have not moved since the Glassfall. Below grade, ceilings drop, corridors thicken with pipes and signs, and a public stair can pass through several centuries of construction before reaching its last stop.

    Equatorial light reaches the city through drifting ring debris. Passing fragments split the daylight across facades and leave moving bands of color on the streets. Residents read the approach of a dense drift from those bands before public weather notices update. Dawn and dusk stretch across repeated reflections from orbit.

    Sitharian is the language of government, contracts, schools, and most street life. Port districts carry many other registers, but anyone dealing with city institutions learns its measured phrasing and precise forms. In conversation, that precision can communicate care, authority, impatience, or all three at once.
