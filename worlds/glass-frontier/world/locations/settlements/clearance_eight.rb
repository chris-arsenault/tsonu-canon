  prose <<~PROSE
    Two narrow fragments carry a capture frame across one of the ring's busiest approaches. Kinetic arrays draw loose material into slots along its outer edge while ships cross the cleared centerline. Rekindling pilots numbered the managed approaches as they restored them; the settlement kept Clearance Eight's service designation.

    Pressure vessels, marked cargo, personal effects, active machines, and worked materials enter the custody docks. Broken plate and exhausted rock enter sorted lots. Fine debris gathers into dense release bundles that tugs send along charted trajectories beyond inhabited traffic.

    Residents read what motion did to an object. A rotating panel records the last collision in its bent edge. Dust inside a sealed seam can place a container near a drive plume. A weak kinetic imprint across a cargo frame shows the ships that towed it and in what order. Those readings decide whether the object enters a claim room, a powered cradle, a quarantine berth, a salvage lot, or an outbound bundle.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :governance, heading: "Eight Desks and a Seal"
    Eight public desks settle recovery and hazard, identity and route, ownership and debt, then salvage value and release. Each adds one impression to #{encyclopedia_ref :eighth_seal, "the Eighth Seal"} fixed to the object. The completed sequence lets a tuned reader recover the evidence behind the final color instead of receiving only the disposition.

    Claimants can accompany an object and answer the readers directly. A disputed machine remains powered in custody while its route and ownership impressions stay open. Household goods wait in sealed rooms arranged by recovery route. Market buyers inspect a lot only after the ownership desk closes its part of the seal.

    #{ref :tangent, "*Tangent*"} patrols the centerline during release work. Its pilot can push an unlisted object back into the capture field and hold traffic while the desks assign it a route.

  gm_note :appears, "Ships reach the docks down an escorted centerline with kinetic arrays pulling loose material into the slots along the frame's outer edge, so anything unlisted riding on a player hull is taken off them before they tie up."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Show a resident any object and they read what motion did to it: a bent panel edge gives its last collision, dust in a sealed seam places it near a drive plume, a weak kinetic imprint names the ships that towed it and in what order."
