  prose <<~PROSE
    Eleven inhabited hulls surround Brake's central fragment. They were built in different eras for different gravities, and streets pass between them through cargo locks, temporary bridges, and torn engine rooms. Permanent routes remain on the central fragment and carry bright orange handrails.

    Wrecks arrive stripped of momentum and leave as sorted plate, machinery, pressure fittings, wire, glass, and sealed cargo. A sound habitat ship can remain intact and petition for ward status after its crew clears fuel, weapons, and unstable systems. Cutter lines reduce one vessel deck by deck while another arrives beside it, changing the settlement's skyline every month.

    The central fragment began as a freight platform fitted with kinetic arrestors. Rekindling salvage crews used those arrays to stop derelicts before cutting them. Pilots called for a tow to the brake, and their working name passed to the settlement growing among the captured ships.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "From Hull to Lots"
    Tug crews bring a derelict into the outer lane and fix it to three independent anchors. Intake teams read pressure, chemical residue, structural tone, and ownership marks. Safe compartments open first for records and personal effects. Fuel, weapons, and live biological systems move to isolated lots.

    Cutting proceeds from the outer hull toward the structural spine. Crews paint every planned line and clear the compartment on both sides before heat or kinetic tools touch it. Salvaged pieces receive a lot mark at removal. Buyers can trace a pressure door or engine brace back to its vessel and deck.

    #{ref :ira_voss, "Ira Voss"} runs intake on inhabited and recently abandoned ships. #{ref :five_bolts, "*Five Bolts*"} handles short tows between the capture lane and the cutting lots. The largest enclosed work happens at #{ref :forty, "Forty"}, whose doors accept a complete cutter hull.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "Wards Made From Ships"
    A crew seeking ward status keeps its ship intact through a thirty-day survey. Brake residents inspect life support, access routes, weapons spaces, and the systems that would couple into the central fragment. The crew then chooses a permanent anchor and opens one public passage through the hull.

    Each ship ward retains its deck plan and household arrangements. Shared law covers pressure safety, trade, docks, and routes across hull boundaries. A narrow mining vessel may sit beside a broad passenger drum, with a school operating through the joined airlocks between them.

    Cutter families often live in former ships whose sister hulls they dismantled. Their homes carry fittings from several wrecks and doors whose old labels point to rooms elsewhere in the yard.
