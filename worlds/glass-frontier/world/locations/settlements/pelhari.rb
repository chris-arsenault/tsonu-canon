  prose <<~PROSE
    A moon of the seventh planet, the water giant #{ref :vastine, "Vastine"}. Pelhari is a single vertical city carved down the wall of a kilometers-deep crater — terraces stacked on terraces, Vastine-facing terraces brightest, shadow-side terraces densest. The crater opens to a sky dominated by the banded face of the parent planet, which fills a fifth of the upper hemisphere and turns slowly through colors that the locals know by name.

    The #{ref :clarisant, "Clarisant"} holds the upper terraces and built its academy here. The rest of the crater belongs to people who were doing other things first, or who have come since to do something else.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :atmosphere, heading: "The Crater"
    The crater is older than the settlement and older than the ring. It pre-dates the Glassfall by an unknown margin. Most geological surveys classify it as an impact crater, while a minority cite its unusually regular geometry as evidence that the cause remains unsettled. Whatever made it left a roughly cylindrical pit some two kilometers across and nearly as deep, with walls steep enough to terrace cleanly.

    The terraces were cut over generations. The upper rim, broadest and brightest, holds the Academy's halls, the observatory, and the senior residences. Descending the crater wall in spiral terraces are the workshops, the markets, the housing for the city's working population, the dock complex around #{ref :span_nine, "Span Nine"}'s terminus, and at the deepest terraces, the ice-mining lifts and the freight yards.

    An address higher on the crater wall carries social status, though polite introductions omit the implication. Public lifts connect every terrace while the distribution of halls, workshops, and housing makes the hierarchy visible.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :origin, heading: "The Observatory"
    The Clarisant joined an upper rim whose oldest structures predate the guild.

    Embedded in the upper terraces is a pre-Glassfall observatory whose original purpose is absent from surviving records. Its ring-era architecture is unmistakable. The central hall is a long crystalline chamber tuned to a resonance state so quiet that a Tuner standing inside it can feel the rest of the system as background hum: a clean room for resonance practice, a place where a trained sense can be calibrated against silence.

    The crater's resonance-quiet pocket extends across most of the upper terraces. Orbital geometry and the parent planet's mass account for part of the effect, but current models cannot account for the crater's full contribution. Other resonance-quiet sites exist; Pelhari offers the most reliable conditions and the easiest long-term habitation among them.

    The observatory itself still functions. The Academy uses it for examinations and for the deepest stages of mastery training. What it was originally observing remains an open question.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "The Outer Voyages"
    #{ref :elian_soreth, "Elian Soreth"}'s 2272 argument for an outer planet grew from positional observations made here. His telescope stood outside the ancient observatory; his work does not establish what its original instruments had been built to observe. Local apprentices repeated the measurements during the Signal Famine. When travel recovered, wrights and shipowners backed the expeditions that produced the #{ref :lithren_landfall, "Lithren Landfall"}.

    The first displayed specimens drew audiences who had contributed money, made instruments or sent relatives aboard. Later performances on #{ref :sereyat, "Sereyat"} made the ruins desirable to patrons who had little interest in astronomy. Some commissions paid for careful excavation. Others paid only for an object impressive enough to display on an upper terrace.

    Present ties to Lithren include research, private collecting and families with relatives in #{ref :ithara, "Ithara"}. Old specimen cases can hold parts separated before the comparative survey. Their owners may welcome a visiting researcher, want payment, or prefer the arrangements in which the pieces have become household possessions. Pelhari's connection to the planet belongs to those different histories as well as to the Academy.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :economy, heading: "Economy"
    The Academy is the largest single employer and the city's defining institution among several independent industries:

    **Span Nine terminus.** One of #{ref :span_nine, "Span Nine"}'s three known termini lands on Pelhari's outer-rim dock complex. The port handles the only Span-bandwidth comms traffic in the outer system. Customs, freight, signal-traffic management, and the small dense bureaucracy that surrounds the terminus together employ thousands. The dock houses are a city within a city, with their own dialect and their own grudges. Among them stands the library of the #{future "Dunmar Hold"}, whose rack of plates from #{ref :yesh_dunmar, "Yesh Dunmar"}'s 2389 crossing of the Fracture draws pilots from every outer port, and whose librarian argues with his aunt most mornings in front of the visitors.

    **Ice mining and water export.** The crater's lower terraces meet veins of clean ice that run kilometers into the moon. Water is extracted, refined, and shipped throughout the outer system. The miners are the city's largest working population and the foundation of the Pelharin middle class. Mining families have worked the veins for generations and treat Tuners as one profession among others.

    **Resonance instrumentation.** The city's wright shops produce some of the system's best resonance instruments: tuned ringglass measurement rigs, training arrays, calibrated reference tools. The wrights work in close contact with the Academy but operate independently, and several wright houses are older than the guild itself. A Pelharin instrument carries a maker's mark that means quality across the system. The best rigs sit on mounts cut from deep-animal tissue that hook-chain crews bring from #{ref :nuvari, "Nuvari"}, which keep an instrument from hearing its own housing.

    **The retreat economy.** People come to Pelhari to recover, to study, to retire, to disappear. The resonance-quiet environment is restorative. The Academy's libraries are open to credentialed scholars from any institution. Long-stay residences along the middle terraces serve pilgrims, sabbatical academics, recovering Tuners, and the occasional well-funded eccentric. The quiet trade in long-stay hospitality is unglamorous and reliable.

    The Academy, mines, docks, and wright shops have separate employers and institutions. Their independence gives Pelhari several centers of civic and economic power, an uncommon arrangement among habs and surface settlements.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "Sky-Watcher Culture"
    The parent planet rules the sky. Vastine's banded face fills a fifth of the upper hemisphere at any time, turning through a slow procession of colors that the Pelharin read like weather. The bands have names. The standing storms have names. The seasonal shifts in the banding pattern — local effects that recur in roughly the same form year after year — have names. A Pelharin child learns the names of the storm-faces before they learn to read.

    The local calendar is keyed to Vastine's appearance. **Storm-face** mornings are bright and turbulent. **Hush-face** mornings are still and gray. **Dark-face** spans are the rare intervals when the parent planet's bands all darken simultaneously and the city's mood follows. Outsiders often find dark-face days unsettling; locals treat that reaction as a newcomer's habit.

    Festivals follow Vastine. The major civic celebrations align with banding events that recur on multi-year cycles, and the planning of a wedding or a major commission is routinely scheduled around the next favorable storm-face. The Academy schedules examinations by the same pattern while downplaying the calendar's influence in its public teaching.

    Outsiders are visible for years. A Tuner who comes to Pelhari for mastery training and stays after may live there for a decade before they stop being read as new. A Pelharin who leaves the moon and returns can pick up local conversation within a day.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    Pelhari is a working city built around an institution that governs only part of it. The Academy defines part of the city's identity while treating Pelhari as the site of its work rather than part of the guild's own identity. Miners, wrights, and dock houses maintain institutions that would continue without the guild. The observatory and resonance-quiet terraces tie the Academy more closely to Pelhari than the other industries depend on it, a dependence the Academy usually acknowledges.

    Current work follows the city's established divisions: examinations and observatory practice on the upper terraces, trade and craft below them, and ice extraction at the crater floor. The changing face of the parent planet sets the schedule across all three.
