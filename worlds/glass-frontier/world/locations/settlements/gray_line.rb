  prose <<~PROSE
    A Displacement Council cordon section surrounding the zone that contains Latch and two empty service fragments. Its official designation is Cordon Station Nine. Crews call the whole assignment Gray Line for the old damping buoys whose casings faded after years of exposure.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "A Long Cordon"
    Gray Line changes slowly enough to train crews and often enough to punish routine. New operators begin on the exterior mounts, then learn the inspection walks and remote recovery stations. The post produced many of the Council's regional leads because a person can work every cordon job there without leaving one boundary.

    Dern Talish served most of her field career at Gray Line. #{ref :iro_senn, "Iro Senn"}, who worked the same watches, now leads the station.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "The Handover Room"
    The same room is where #{ref :oram_sells, "Oram Sells"} told #{ref :dern_talish, "Dern Talish"} about the Council's hidden contact with the elves before he died. The families who come to read the Latch registry sit at the table where it happened and know nothing of it.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "The Registry Room"
    One sealed room holds the surviving Latch registry, recovery requests, and objects brought back from the outer service arc. Families may inspect the records but cannot authorize a crossing.
