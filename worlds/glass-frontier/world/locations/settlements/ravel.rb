  prose <<~PROSE
    Ravel crosses a thin plume of water vapor, mineral dust, and organic grains once every nine days. Collector webs open ahead of the passage and fold against the fragment before its orbit carries them into ordinary traffic. The catch supplies water, industrial salts, trace metals, and small quantities of material altered by the plume's uneven resonance field.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Webs Beyond the Hull"
    Twelve main booms extend from the fragment like narrow bridge arms. Each carries reels, tension frames, and guide lights. Fine mesh spans the spaces between them during a catch. Larger salvage nets trail beyond the main frame and collect ice clumps after their speed has been reduced by the forward cloth.

    The first Rekindling crew to come alongside saw loose Ring Age collector line wound around the whole fragment in snarls, and wrote "the ravel" in their manifest. New mesh replaced the old line long ago. Traffic controllers still use the name, and the residents have kept it.

    Habitation sits behind a thick central shield. The dock, processing rooms, and water tanks occupy the sheltered face. Crew quarters line the boom roots, close enough that a worker can reach a reel after a pressure alarm. Windows face sideways across the web and show the plume arriving as a pale band against the stars.

    A damaged net can pull a boom out of alignment. Crews release whole panels when strain crosses the red mark, then recover them after the passage with tender craft. Every panel carries a broad owner stripe and smaller repair marks along its edge.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Nine-Day Work"
    The two days before a passage belong to line inspection, mesh repair, and instrument calibration. During the catch, boom crews work in paired cabins and watch physical strain alongside resonance readings. Processing begins as soon as the first inner panels fold. Water ice moves directly to melt tanks; mineral catch waits in grounded bins until its field response settles.

    Families and work crews hold shares in particular panels. A strong catch pays by weight after common water and maintenance portions. Repair marks preserve the history of a panel through sale and inheritance. Experienced buyers inspect the stitching before reading the last ten yields.

    When the last inner panel folds, the dock opens the first melt tank to everyone. Crews drink the plume water hot with salt from the same catch, and the panel families who did well that passage buy the fried dough. Arguments over whose net sagged and whose cabin called the release too early start at the tank and run until the inspection days.

    Tender crews spend the open days recovering released mesh, testing anchors, and guiding visiting carriers. #{ref :nera_doss, "*Nera Doss*"} works the outermost lines and carries the joined household names of the crew that established Ravel's first safe spread.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Warm Catch"
    For the last three passages two outer panels have come in with clear droplets at their centers. The droplets stay liquid in the cold processing rooms and spread into a thin film that creeps across ceramic trays, and when two films meet the signal sounders chatter. Ravel keeps the catch in separate pressure cells, the two panels hang open on their booms for inspection, and three buyers have already come out on the Keel branch to look at it.

    One panel belongs to the Harrow family, who have held it for four generations and who owe money on its last restitching. Wen Harrow wants to sell the droplets as mineral catch, which pays the panel's holders by weight. The common hall says anything that melts and flows is water and goes into the common portion first, and Oska Lume, who keeps the hall's tally, has locked the pressure cells until the passage-day meeting. Lume's own crew holds the second affected panel, and the Harrows point this out to anyone who will listen.

    #{ref :nera_doss, "*Nera Doss*"} is carrying one sealed tray through the next plume passage while hull instruments compare it with the material still on the web. Both sides have asked the tender crew to report to them first.

  gm_note :triggered_by, "Players who offer to buy, salvage, or claim a collector panel find that its owner stripe and edge repair marks are the ownership record, and that the family holding shares in it reads the last ten yields before naming a price."
  gm_note :complicates, "A struggle, an accident, or an improvised maneuver out on the web during a catch pushes a boom past its red strain mark, and the crews answer by releasing the whole panel. Someone's inherited share then drifts into the plume until a tender recovers it."
