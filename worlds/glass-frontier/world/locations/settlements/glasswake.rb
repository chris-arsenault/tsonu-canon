  prose <<~PROSE
    Glasswake is a coastal mining town built around the ruins of a ring hab fragment that fell during the #{ref :the_glassfall, "Glassfall"}. The wreck forms a fused ridge along the eastern edge of town. Homes, workshops, mines, and warehouses occupy the sheltered ground between it and the sea.

    The fragment's inter-hab communication equipment lay buried in the wreckage for #{elapsed :the_glassfall, :the_rekindling} and needed only minor repair to function. A salvage crew found a transmitter that still had power, and one of them knew enough to make it talk. The signal reached #{ref :hab_meridian, "Hab Meridian"} and began the #{ref :the_rekindling, "Rekindling"}.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :geography, heading: "Wreck Ridge and Coast"
    The ridge runs for several kilometers and rises high enough to break the prevailing wind. From the seaward side it resembles dark stone threaded with pale glass. The inland face exposes rooms, conduits, pressure doors, and structural ribs from the fallen hab. Some openings lead into worked mines. Others remain sealed because the surrounding material carries load in ways surveyors have not mapped.

    Older streets follow the base of the ridge. The harbor and lower yards spread west toward the coast, while newer housing climbs the gentler slopes north and south. Mine roads enter the ridge at several levels and emerge at sorting terraces above town. Dust screens and wash stations stand wherever those roads cross public streets.

    The coast is rocky near the harbor and broadens into beaches farther north. Storms throw ordinary sand against ringglass debris and leave thin bright lines after the water retreats. Children collect the visible pieces; mine crews warn them away from any patch that answers a tool strike.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :origin, heading: "Origin"
    No surviving record identifies the original ring hab, its name, or its residents. Glasswake's town records and mining practice treat the fragment as a working resource rather than a heritage site. Miners work the ringglass deposits in the impact debris. Old hab structures serve as foundations and warehouses, and one intact service room houses a pub.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :economy, heading: "Economy"
    Mining remains the town's largest industry. The impact debris field holds a consistent volume of low-grade #{encyclopedia_ref :ringglass, "ringglass"} aggregate, and current surveys project decades of accessible material. The work supports sorting yards, repair shops, freight crews, and the households around them.

    The town also sorts shower glass brought down by the #{ref :prismwell_kite_guild, "Prismwell Kite Guild"} and handles freight for western #{ref :avar, "Avar"}. Repair yards build mine fittings, kite catch frames, pumps, and road gear; #{ref :three_arms_yard, "Three Arms Yard"} handles the flexible frames used by shower scouts. The #{ref :pell_freight_assembly, "Pell Freight Assembly"} pools cargo work among independent crews based here.

    Glasswake's sorting terraces also hold the most trusted grading bench in the system. #{ref :innik_vosk, "Innik Vosk"}, a heshari grader from a ridge cutting-yard family, bites a coin of offcut from each lot and seals it to the load, and Shear crews ship lots down the Keel spur for his bite before selling at Keelward. His waiting list runs about a season, and Keelward finance clerks meet crews at the spur to buy their glass before it reaches him.

    Reconnection history brings visitors. The old transmitter building is a museum, and the first-signal trail climbs from town through the upper wreck to the hab's surviving transmitter mast. Inns, guides, food stalls, and shops selling stamped ringglass support a modest tourist trade. Museum fees pay for preservation of the transmitter rooms and the public path through the upper wreck.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "Mine Town and Port"
    Glasswake shifts follow mine lifts, harbor tides, and kite arrivals. Sorting terraces begin early to use the cooler part of the day. Harbor crews work the water. Repair yards and shops bridge both schedules. Schools post their calendar beside the mine closure board because a major survey or shower front changes which adults are available for pickup.

    Mine crews include cutters, surveyors, haulers, washers, and structural readers. A cutter follows the grade. A structural reader decides whether removing it will wake another seam or transfer load into an occupied part of the wreck. Apprentices begin in the wash yards, where material can be sounded without standing under it.

    The dock fringe receives #{encyclopedia_ref :ratters, "Ratter"} crews, steppe carriers, and independent kites that avoid the larger fees at Sithari. Lodging houses, chandlers, and late markets face the harbor. #{ref :the_dry_net, "The Dry Net"} combines cheap beds, sealed equipment storage, and an open hiring wall. Uptown offices handle #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} inspections and mineral contracts. A load unloaded on the fringe may enter uptown as a certified mineral lot after washing, grading, and inspection.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :atmosphere, heading: "Atmosphere"
    Mine dust reaches every street near the ridge. Buildings use ringglass-reinforced stone, deep awnings, and grated entries where workers can leave boots and outer clothes. The fallen hab dominates the skyline, weathered into a dark slope until an old room or structural rib emerges from it.

    The transmitter mast that sent the first signal still stands on the crest of the ridge, bent where the fall twisted it and braced with cable the town replaces every few winters. Tourists climb to it. Locals give directions by it: "Past the mast, take the left fork."

    A surface-access spur connects Glasswake to #{ref :keel, "the Keel"}, the system's primary orbital trade lane. Kites descending from the Keel use the town as a minor waypoint and resupply stop.

  gm_note :appears, "Cargo and hiring both come in at the dock fringe, where kites, #{encyclopedia_ref :ratters, "Ratter"} crews, and steppe carriers dodge Sithari's fees; inspections and mineral contracts sit uptown. A crew can be hired at one end of that walk in the morning and audited at the other by evening."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Whatever the party brings off a claim only exists uptown after washing, grading and a #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} inspection turn it into a certified lot. The fringe buys the same material unwashed, for less, and asks nothing about where it came from."
  gm_note :complicates, "Taking anything out of the wreck ridge is a structural reader's call rather than a cutter's, because pulling a grade can wake a second seam or shift load into an occupied part of the fragment. Crews who open a sealed face anyway learn which rooms underneath were carrying it."
