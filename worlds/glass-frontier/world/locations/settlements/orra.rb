  prose <<~PROSE
    A dead Ring Age carrier fills nearly half of Orra's usable volume. The animal died during the Glassfall with its body locked into a nursery cradle, and the surviving pressure shell closed around both. Pale ribs now cross public halls, while engineered fungi fill the old digestive folds.

    The outer districts work the dry hide and harness structure. The warm interior supports food beds, medicinal cultures, and teams studying tissue that has continued changing for #{elapsed :the_glassfall, approx: true}. Streets pass between them through machine rooms, cultivated cavities, and chambers cut into the carrier itself.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "The Body in the Cradle"
    Ring Age service plans call the nursery Orivar, shortened to Orra in Famine speech. The carrier's forward plates meet the old nursery docks, while its long body curves through a cradle of ceramic spars and structural ringglass. Early residents opened the dry upper cavities first. Later crews reached the marrow channels, fermentation chambers, and fluid reservoirs held deeper inside.

    Each layer has its own air and working hazards. The outer hide sheds hard scales that crews cut into pressure patches. Fungal districts stay warm and wet. Marrow galleries carry pockets of sweet gas that ignite under a kinetic spark. Old service passages run beside the body and give rescue crews a clean route around most inhabited chambers.

    The carrier's material changes in a measured sequence. Hide becomes scale and fiber. Soft tissue feeds fungi and pale rootstock. Mineralized ribs yield strong porous ceramic after heat treatment. Orra records the boundary of each stage because a workshop built for one material can become unsafe when the layer beneath it changes.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "Cutters, Growers, and Deep Readers"
    Outer cutters remove only material released from the body by mapped fractures. Growers manage the fungal beds and the insects that pollinate Orra's food plants. Deep readers take temperature, chemistry, and structural-tone measurements from probes seated along the spine. Most households include people from more than one of these trades.

    A district approaching a new stage receives crews and equipment from the district that reached it earlier. The practice moves expertise around Orra and gives older neighborhoods a continuing stake in younger ones. It also creates arguments over timing. A cutter sees a clean plate ready for removal; the grower below may need another season of shade from it.

    #{ref :orra_marrower_colonies, "Marrower colonies"} move through channels too narrow for a person. Their feeding exposes warm tissue and blocked fluid pockets. Deep crews follow their tracks during surveys and seal them away from cultivated chambers.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Heat Under the Sternum"
    Three probes beneath the central sternum now record a slow pulse of heat and ion exchange. The cycle repeats every eleven hours and travels along living nerve bundles before fading at the third rib. Samples taken from the same tissue close shallow cuts within a day.

    Orra has cleared the overlying apartments and opened the old nursery service gallery for study. Growers want the warm tissue isolated for propagation. Cutters have found pressure marks indicating movement against the cradle. Deep readers are placing a fourth probe at the point where the signal enters the spine.

  gm_note :appears, "An ordinary walk across Orra passes through dry hide, a warm wet fungal district, and a marrow gallery within a few streets. The galleries hold pockets of sweet gas that a kinetic spark will light, so tuned tools are carried dead through them or left at the boundary."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Removing anything from a chamber puts the cutters above and the growers below into the same argument: the plate has come free of a mapped fracture and is ready to lift, and the beds under it want another season of its shade."
  gm_note :complicates, "Samples from beneath the sternum close shallow cuts within a day, and the apartments above that tissue are already empty. Anyone hurt near the nursery gallery gets offered a sample, and afterwards the growers and the deep readers both want to know what it did."
