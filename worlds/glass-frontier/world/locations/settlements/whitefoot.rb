    setting:
      "An open field north of Sithari where the old conduit meets a low " \

      "flare of light marking the point of entry. Around it stand " \

      "that step Span traffic down to modern bandwidth.",
    activity:

    access:
      "A buried signal trunk and an electric rail line connect the yard " \

  prose <<~PROSE
    The surface terminus of #{ref :span_nine, "Span Nine"}, outside Sithari's northern municipal boundary. The old conduit meets a low ringglass platform in an open field and rises from it as a white filament. The common name describes the broad flare of light where the filament enters the platform.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "The Surface Yard"
    Whitefoot contains the terminus platform, isolated signal rooms, a customs hall, and the converter banks that reduce Span traffic to bandwidth modern systems can carry. Nothing in the yard controls the conduit. Operators select channels, verify receiving stations, and disconnect local equipment when a response exceeds its limits.

    A buried signal trunk and an electric rail line connect the yard to Sithari's Old Campus. The trip is short enough for daily work and long enough that a Span closure does not place the city above an active terminus.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "Before the City"
    The platform, Pelhari observatory, and Threshold Station all predate the modern settlements around them. Surviving records do not state why the conduit joined those facilities. Pelhari grew around its relay. Sithari's post-Glassfall administration grew around the nearby campus that had the instruments and records needed to restore Whitefoot.

    Reactivation increased Sithari's reach, but the city did not acquire the terminus by chance or contain it within the capital. Whitefoot remains a separate station under Sitharian maintenance and its own access rules.
  PROSE

  gm_note :appears, "Sending anything off-world from the surface means coming out to the yard in person: an operator assigns the channel, the receiving station is verified before traffic starts, and the customs hall handles whatever crosses with it. A message goes to a station that has answered, never to a person."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "The moment a response runs past what local equipment can take, operators disconnect it and the exchange stops mid-sentence. Nothing in the yard controls the conduit, so a party's business finishes when the converter banks say so rather than when the speakers are done."
  gm_note :complicates, "The yard keeps its own access rules outside Sithari's municipal boundary while drawing every staffer, every watt and every customs officer up the rail line from the city. A quarrel with the capital reaches Whitefoot as a staffing or transport problem, not as an order about the Span."
