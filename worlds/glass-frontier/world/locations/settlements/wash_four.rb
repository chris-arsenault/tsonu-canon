  prose <<~PROSE
    Every arriving person and load enters on the dirty side. Clothing, webbing, soft cases, filters, and insulation move through separate drums according to material and source. The clean side opens onto drying lofts where warm air lifts cloth through hanging frames. Markets occupy the space below, selling repaired pressure layers, sailcloth, bedding, uniforms, and bundles of authenticated scrap textile.

    Ringglass mordant in pressure cloth retains coherent signal traces where friction or load drives them into the fiber. A mining coat carries tool rhythms at its cuffs. A courier bag records repeated route beacons along its straps. Each wash weakens the quietest layer; heat and a stronger tuned pattern can overwrite it. Workers draw recoverable traces into rinse water, fix useful portions onto ceramic, and discharge the remainder through grounded drying frames.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Thirty-One"
    #{ref :thirty_one, "Thirty-One"} receives garments associated with injuries, failed seals, contaminated cargo, and disputed journeys. #{ref :tess_orr, "Tess Orr"} lays each piece across an isolated table and maps its strongest trace before any liquid touches it.

    The first wash uses plain water and hand pressure. Later cycles add heat, mineral grit, tuned paddles, or stillwater according to the map. Trace washers sample every drain. A sudden coherent pattern can identify the tool, room, or signal source that last impressed the cloth.

    The bay keeps the #{ref :red_sleeve, "Red Sleeve"} for field comparisons. Its fabric has carried the same speaking voice through three owners and many complete wash cycles.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "Clothes With a Chain of Custody"
    Wash Four residents mark garments by use. White stitching records pressure integrity, blue records biological treatment, yellow records signal clearing, and green records a recovered trace stored with the owner. Repairers place each new mark beside the latest treatment and leave the older chain visible. The service designation Decontamination Habitat Four remains painted across the cylinder; Rekindling manifests shortened it after clean-route pilots made the hab a transfer point.

    Formal clothing often includes one visibly replaced panel from a family garment. Work crews exchange marked cuffs when members change jobs. Children receive layered coats whose inner seams carry the wash marks of older siblings and cousins.

    Traders pay more for cloth with a complete route through the dirty dock, wash bay, repair loft, and clean market. The stitched chain matters on ships where fabric passes through several hands before becoming a sail, seal, sling, or pressure patch.

                         "green for a trace the owner still holds, with every older mark left standing beside the new one."
  gm_note :appears, "Cloth sells here on its chain, so a piece with an unbroken route through dirty dock, wash bay, repair loft and clean market fetches a premium and a gap in the marks invites questions about that cycle."
