  prose <<~PROSE
    Three hundred residents maintain field pylons, stores, kitchens, clinics, and empty berths through most of the year. The first sighting transforms the hab. Ferries bring cutters, cooks, buyers, veterinarians, instrument makers, and families returning to the same temporary ward. Folded decks spread outward from the core and bright guide streamers fill the saddle.

    Sarn arrive in long spirals, riding the field between fragments. Adults shed old flight combs as they turn. Crews gather the combs after they separate, trim away living tissue, and sort them by size and resonance. Flexible pieces become hull vanes and instruments. Dense root plates become heat spreaders and kinetic tool faces.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "A City for One Passage"
    Seasonal wards take the names of their first arriving vessel. Their cooks feed the deck crews, their riggers maintain a band of collection lines, and their readers record the health and path of the passing animals. A vessel that returns late joins whichever ward has open berths. The permanent platform was a rigger's perch in the path of the migration; collectors kept the working name as they extended it into a settlement.

    Permanent residents assign collection bands from the previous passage records. Wards earn wider bands by returning injured sarn to the spiral, clearing abandoned line, and leaving their decks ready to fold. The closing market begins when the last healthy animal crosses the far fragment.

    #{ref :pava_lorn, "Pava Lorn"} reads the migration from the outer pylons. #{ref :molt, "*Molt*"} works below the main spiral, gathering separated combs and carrying exhausted crews back to the hab.

  gm_note :appears, "A vessel that moors during the passage gives its name to a ward, or joins whichever ward still has open berths if it came in late; the players' ship acquires cooks, riggers and a band of collection lines whether or not they asked for any."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Returning an injured sarn to the spiral, clearing abandoned line, or leaving a deck ready to fold is what earns a ward a wider collection band next passage, so favors done at Perch are repaid in harvest width rather than in coin."
  gm_note :complicates, "The closing market opens when the last healthy animal crosses the far fragment rather than on any date, so a party holding goods for a better price can find the whole hab folding its decks a week before they expected to sell."
