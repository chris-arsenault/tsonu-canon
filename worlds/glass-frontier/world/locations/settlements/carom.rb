  prose <<~PROSE
    Meals, medicine, parcels, tools, and personal messages cross Carom in batches. Each load enters a painted sorting floor, leaves in another carrier's hands, and may change hands again before reaching the right neighborhood. Local couriers read the receiving segment, drum, table, and final route from one compact mark at walking speed.

    The settlement occupies three hab segments that retained different rotation rates after the Glassfall. Transfer drums join them for only a few minutes. Their frame locks carry a distinct kinetic tone during each alignment, so a courier pushing a load can feel which drum is open through the handle. Visiting freight systems usually read the first transfer and lose the parcel when the drums change order.

    Famine couriers learned to use whichever drum aligned next and bounce loads between sorting decks until they reached the correct segment. Their route cards called the maneuver a carom. The exchange and then the settlement kept the word.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "The Sort"
    Each segment has one main exchange and several neighborhood tables. Incoming carriers unload wheeled frames whose shelves match the destination colors painted on the floor. Couriers break the load into smaller frames, walk them to the next band, and rebuild them in the order needed at the far drum.

    The route marks combine color, shape, and two short numbers. Color gives the segment. Shape gives the exchange. The first number identifies the neighborhood table and the second the carrier group. A chalk stroke across the mark records a temporary diversion. A clipped corner sends the parcel back through the same route after delivery. Couriers press a tuned ceramic stud through the corner; its vibration identifies the next drum when paint is hidden or the sorting deck is dark.

    #{ref :rattle, "Rattle"} handles the busiest drum and most off-hab traffic. #{ref :mik_sorn, "Mik Sorn"} runs its medical and hot-meal route. The hab-runner #{ref :tally, "*Tally*"} moves delayed frames between outer docks when the rotating connection would spoil their contents.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "A Place That Changes Hands"
    Carom residents eat food prepared across all three segments. School work, repaired clothing, spare keys, and borrowed tools travel through the same exchanges. Children learn their home mark before they learn the full layout of the hab. Older residents can often identify a carrier group from the way its workers tie a frame.

    Couriers work in small cooperatives. Reputation follows accurate transfers and the ability to recover from a changed drum sequence. Every exchange keeps a correction wall showing damaged marks, unusual routes, and the final delivery. The walls teach apprentices and settle payment when a parcel crosses extra hands.

    A sealed white case marked for Neighborhood Eight has passed through Rattle on four consecutive days. Each recipient accepted the case, opened it, and returned an empty shelf. The case came back full at the next morning sort with the same weight and seal. Mik Sorn has moved the fifth delivery onto his own route.
