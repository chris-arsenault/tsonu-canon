  prose <<~PROSE
    Xyloathax is an inhabited ring hab in a clean orbit of Kaleidos. Its old name survives in spoken form; the intact wall script begins with the same sounds and continues for another line. The hab curves around a narrow garden valley, with homes and workshops set into both walls and a service truss crossing the open side.

    A #{ref :bloom_zones, "Bloom Zone"} appeared beside the sunward truss in 2431. The boundary cut through empty space, one cargo rail, and the outer end of a pressure conduit without spreading into the inhabited arc. Xyloathax remained structurally stable. Its council rejected evacuation after three independent surveys found no displacement inside the main hull.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Living Beside the Boundary"
    The #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"} closed the sunward dock and established two approach corridors on the far arc. Arriving vessels stop at an outer buoy, surrender automatic docking control, and follow a local pilot through a path whose distance is checked by paired clocks. A clock disagreement closes the corridor until a Tuner and a pilot survey it together.

    Inside the hab, the zone is visible through the valley's open side as a dark break across the truss. Residents use the truss shadow to mark meals and work shifts because ordinary sunlight passes around it. Children born since the boundary appeared learn the cordon colors with their dock signs. Families keep evacuation cases by their inner doors and continue to tend the gardens below them.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    The outer buoy has begun arriving early according to the dock clocks and on time according to its own isolated mechanism. The discrepancy is small and grows after each supply transfer. The Council has reduced traffic to one corridor while Xyloathax's mechanics install a third clock on the hab wall.

    The hab council will close both corridors if the wall clock disagrees with the vessel pair. The #{ref :ring_collective, "Ring Collective"} is holding emergency berths at #{ref :hab_meridian, "Hab Meridian"}, while Xyloathax's growers move the next harvest into sealed storage.

  gm_note :appears, "Vessels stop at the outer buoy, surrender automatic docking control to a local pilot, and run the approach against paired clocks. A disagreement between the two closes that corridor until a Tuner and a pilot have surveyed it together."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Raising evacuation with the hab council gets the three independent surveys quoted back, none of which found displacement inside the main hull. Residents keep cases by their inner doors and go on tending the gardens below the truss."
  gm_note :complicates, "The outer buoy reads early on the dock clocks and on time on its own mechanism, and the gap widens after every supply transfer, so each delivery makes the next approach worse while only one corridor is still open."
