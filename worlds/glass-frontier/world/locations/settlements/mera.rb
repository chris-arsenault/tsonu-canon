  prose <<~PROSE
    A slow tumble leaves Mera's main courts in shadow for weeks. Residents use the cold season to grow immense ice columns from circulating water. During the bright return, the columns melt through channels that feed homes, gardens, baths, and workshops.

    The settlement changes shape around them. Winter walkways climb frozen terraces. Spring watercourses cross the same courts. Shops move from high platforms to the exposed floor as the columns narrow. Painted depth lines and permanent ceramic stairs let a resident recognize an address through every phase.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Growing the Columns"
    Water rises through pipes inside a framework of #{encyclopedia_ref :thawglass, "thawglass"}. Fine spray freezes onto the frame and builds outward. Crews redirect the nozzles through the cold weeks, producing broad bases, hollow storage rooms, and shaded faces that melt in a chosen order.

    Each column belongs to a water ward. The first melt fills drinking tanks. Later flow reaches gardens and process lines. Public columns carry stairs, cold rooms, and market platforms while they stand. Smaller household columns keep food and release water into local cisterns.

    Mera closes the outer spray court when light reaches the first red depth line. Crews recover nozzle frames from within the ice and open spill channels toward the bright-season reservoirs.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "What the Thaw Reveals"
    Residents carve murals, family marks, and short promises into the clear outer layers. Meltwater blurs them from the bottom upward. Permanent records stay on ceramic panels fixed to the court walls; the ice carries messages intended for one season. The oldest words anywhere in Mera are stamped on the Ring Age tanks beneath the courts, Merath-Ilyen, and the seasonal freight crews who first loaded water here clipped them to the name the fragment uses now.

    Rooms buried inside a public column open as doors melt free. Winter stores become spring stalls. Musicians use the narrowing chambers for performances whose tone changes every day. Children race leaf-sized floats through the first open channels.
