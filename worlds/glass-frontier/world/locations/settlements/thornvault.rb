  prose <<~PROSE
    The headquarters of the #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"}. A literal bridge-castle: a single immense stone span across the deepest canyon in the #{ref :sable_crescent, "Sable Crescent"}, with the Conclave's halls, archives, and residences built into and across the span itself. The #{ref :kaleidos_echo_rivers, "Echo River"} runs at the canyon's base. The Vault listens down into the water.

    Thornvault is the Conclave. The Conclave's satellite offices in #{ref :sithari, "Sithari"} and elsewhere are postings; Thornvault is the institutional center, the deep archive, and the place every senior archivist eventually spends years living in. The structure is older than the Conclave by a margin nobody has measured.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :atmosphere, heading: "The Span"
    The canyon is roughly four hundred meters across at the span's narrowest point and approaches a kilometer deep. The original bridge — a single arched span of pale stone — is pre-Glassfall and possibly older. No surviving record describes its construction. The arch is unbroken stone, joined by methods that current masonry cannot reproduce. The bridge has held weather, earthquake, and the long centuries since the Famine without visible degradation.

    The Conclave built upward and downward from the span. The bridge's upper surface holds the public face of the Vault: the formal entrance hall, the consulting rooms where outside parties come to request authentication services, the residences of the senior staff, and the great reading galleries that catch the late afternoon light off the canyon walls. The bridge's lower surface holds the working archive: long halls cantilevered from the underside of the arch, supported by buttresses that grow downward from the span like roots. The lowest galleries are within meters of the Echo River's surface and are explicitly tuned to receive what surfaces in it.

    The whole structure is layered vertically. **The upper galleries** hold recent records, working files, and the day-to-day archive that consulting archivists actually use. **The mid-galleries** hold the older bound records, the Conclave's accumulated case histories, and the verified Echo River transcriptions that have stood up to long examination. **The lower galleries** — the deep vault, the river-facing halls — hold the oldest material: pre-Glassfall fragments still under analysis, anomalous recordings whose provenance is uncertain, and the long sequences that the Conclave has not yet decided what to do with. The deeper the gallery, the older the record. Visitors are not permitted below the mid-galleries without specific authorization and a senior archivist's escort.

    The architecture is functional and beautiful in roughly equal measure. The crystal inlays in the gallery walls are practical resonance dampening, but they also throw the canyon's reflected light through the halls in patterns that change through the day. The buttresses are structural, but their growth pattern from the bridge's underside makes the lower archive look, from the river, like a hanging forest. The Conclave is aware of the building's beauty and has not, to anyone's knowledge, ever commented on it in writing.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "The Approach"
    Thornvault has two practical approaches.

    **The high road** runs along the canyon's eastern rim from #{ref :ledgerfall, "Ledgerfall"}, the nearest settlement, a half-day's travel away. The road is well-maintained, well-traveled by Conclave business, and unimpressive. Most visitors arrive this way. The road ends at the eastern terminus of the bridge, where the Vault's formal entrance and visitor reception sit.

    **The river path** is for archivists and authorized personnel. A series of switchback stairs cut into the western canyon wall connect the bridge's underside to the river's edge, where small Conclave craft can dock at a sheltered landing. The river path is how senior archivists access the lower galleries and how the Conclave moves material it does not want to display publicly. The path is patrolled and not signposted.

    There is no third approach. The canyon walls are not climbable in any practical sense at the Vault's location, and the airspace above the canyon has #{encyclopedia_ref :resonance, "resonance"} properties that interfere with #{encyclopedia_ref :kite, "kite"} operation in ways pilots find sufficiently uncomfortable to avoid. The Conclave's predecessors chose the site for these features and the Conclave maintains the choice.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "Daily Life"
    Thornvault houses, at any given time, between two and three hundred resident archivists, plus support staff, students, and the occasional outside scholar on standing permission to consult specific records. The residences are along the eastern half of the upper bridge. The dining halls, the libraries, the lecture rooms, and the conservatory greenhouse (which the Conclave maintains for reasons that are functional, theoretical, and aesthetic in roughly that order) occupy the central span.

    The Vault's working rhythm is set by the canyon's light. The reading galleries face east and west; morning work happens on the east side, afternoon work on the west, midday is for meals and meetings, and the late afternoon's long horizontal light through the western galleries is when the most concentrated work happens. The pattern has held since the Conclave took the Vault in 2308 and has shaped the Conclave's institutional culture in ways that the Conclave does not entirely admit but that visiting researchers notice immediately. Decisions are made in the late afternoon. Difficult conversations happen in the late afternoon. The Conclave's most important meetings are scheduled in the late afternoon.

    The lower galleries operate on a different schedule. The river-facing halls work in shifts, because the Echo River does not surface material on a daily cycle and the listening posts are staffed around the clock. The lower-gallery archivists are a distinct subculture within the Conclave — quieter, more nocturnal, more comfortable in the company of fragments than people. They eat at odd hours. They surface to the upper galleries for specific consultations and disappear back down. The senior Conclave leadership treats them with the careful respect that any institution shows to the people who do its most specialized and least pleasant work.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "What Is Held"
    The Vault's holdings are extensive and not fully catalogued. The Conclave has spent #{elapsed 2308, approx: true} cataloguing them and estimates that the work is roughly two-thirds complete.

    The bulk of the holdings is Echo River transcription: recorded fragments, decoded sequences, and the working files that document the analysis behind each. The transcription archive is the largest single body of pre-Glassfall material in the system. Most of it is mundane — fragments of administrative chatter, partial commercial transactions, weather data, the small voice of a civilization in the middle of its daily life. Some of it is not. The Conclave does not publish a list of which is which.

    Alongside the transcription archive are the verified pre-Glassfall artifacts the Conclave has acquired or authenticated. The artifact holdings are small in number and large in significance. Most are recordings — physical media, ringglass-encoded data, occasionally items that play back when handled correctly. Some are objects whose function the Conclave has not determined and is in no hurry to publish guesses about.

    The deepest holdings — material in the lower galleries that has not been moved upward and probably will not be — include sequences from the #{ref :disappearance_of_the_elves, "elven disappearance"} that the Conclave has classified as unreleased. The classification is not formally secret. The material is available to credentialed researchers who file the right request and accept the right conditions. The Conclave's quiet position is that some of what surfaced in those years was not meant for general circulation and is better held than published. The position is not universally shared inside the Conclave. The argument is old and has not been resolved.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    The Vault has been the Conclave's headquarters for #{elapsed :echo_ledger_conclave}. It has expanded, in small increments, throughout that period, but its essential architecture — the original pre-Glassfall span, the layered galleries above and below, the deep listening halls at the river's edge — has not changed. The canyon's light still moves through the galleries. The river still surfaces material in the deep halls. The senior archivists still meet in the late afternoon to argue about who gets to see what.

    The Vault is open to visitors with business and inhospitable to visitors without. Authentication clients come through the high road and are received at the upper entrance. Scholars on standing permission make their way to whichever gallery their work requires. The general public, if it shows up — which it does, occasionally — is given a polite tour of the visitor galleries and sent on its way. The Conclave is not unfriendly. It is not, in any sense the general public would recognize, friendly.

    The work continues. The records grow. The river keeps surfacing. Thornvault keeps listening.
