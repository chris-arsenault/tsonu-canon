  prose <<~PROSE
    Rattle is Carom's largest sorting deck. Exchange C remains painted above the main doors from the Ring Age transfer drum, but couriers named the deck for the frame wheels striking its expansion gaps. Six floor colors radiate from the unloading lane toward neighborhood tables, cold lockers, meal racks, and the drum queue.

    The exchange stays loud through every alignment. Frame wheels strike gaps in the deck. Drum bells announce five minutes, two minutes, and closure. Couriers call route changes across the colored bands while residents wait behind the outer rail for hand delivery.

    The correction wall covers the passage to the cold lockers. Its oldest surviving card records a parcel that crossed all three segments nineteen times before reaching a room beside the exchange where it began.
