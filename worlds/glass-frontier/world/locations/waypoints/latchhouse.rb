  prose <<~PROSE
    Latchhouse is a waiting hall, lodging house, and freight court inside Mareth's third locking cylinder. Gate plans and freight marks call it Third Latch. The round main room follows the latch wall. Sleeping cabinets occupy its upper curve, cook stalls line the stable inner ledge, and freight rests on the broad floor around the central guide shaft.

    The room rolls a fraction during every gate cycle. Furniture hangs from pivoting frames, bowls have weighted bases, and the floor carries parallel grip rails. Regular travelers choose beds by the sound each latch tooth makes through the wall.

    A fifth tone now rises through the sealed base of the guide shaft. Hairline joints have appeared around a circular floor plate beneath the freight scales. The hall remains open, and its tables fill before each test of the gate.

  log "2026-08-21 — Made the residents' name Latchhouse primary while retaining Third Latch on gate plans and freight marks."

  gm_note :appears, "Regulars pick their sleeping cabinet by which latch tooth they can hear through the wall, and they have had first choice for years. Anyone booking on arrival takes what is left, which is the curve where the working teeth are loudest."
  gm_note :complicates, "The whole round room rolls a fraction on every gate cycle, so freight, spilled drink and anything set down on the floor migrates toward the guide shaft. The cook stalls on the inner ledge are the only surface in the hall that stays put."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Anyone who looks under the freight scales finds hairline joints tracing a circular plate in the floor, with the fifth tone rising through the sealed base of the shaft beneath it. Service continues over the top of it and the tables fill before every test of the gate."
