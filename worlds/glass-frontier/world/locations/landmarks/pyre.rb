  prose <<~PROSE
    The ruin of a #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"} ringglass refinery in the mid-drift #{ref :the_shear, "Shear"}, and the origin point of the #{ref :the_silent_bloom, "Silent Bloom"} resonance cascade. Pyre sits inside a #{ref :bloom_zones, "Bloom Zone"} now — one of the worst ones. Space is badly warped. The refinery's structure is still recognizable from outside the containment cordon, but what's inside doesn't follow consistent geometry anymore.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    Pyre is one of the most dangerous and valuable sites in the system. The Bloom Zone that formed around it contains some of the most severe reality distortion anywhere in Kaleidos orbit — spatial relationships are unreliable, resonance frequencies stack in unpredictable ways, and the boundary between the zone and normal space requires constant #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"} containment.

    It is also a rich source of #{encyclopedia_ref :bloom_relics, "Bloom relics"} and #{encyclopedia_ref :duskgrain, "duskgrain"}. The same reality distortion that makes Pyre lethal also produces artifacts of narrow-bandwidth power that don't exist anywhere else. #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"}'s black market operations include runs into Pyre's periphery — former employees who know the refinery's layout navigating the warped interior for salvage that commands extraordinary prices.

    The name is what Coremark crews called the facility. When the cascade hit and the refinery burned with pale resonance fire visible across the mid-drift, the name took on its other meaning. The name has carried both meanings since.

  gm_note :appears, "#{encyclopedia_ref :duskgrain, "Duskgrain"} and #{encyclopedia_ref :bloom_relics, "Bloom relics"} on any market trace back to a periphery run, and every such run was guided by someone who worked the refinery floor before it burned. Buying either leaves the party one question away from meeting that guide."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Navigating by the refinery's remembered layout works inward from the cordon line and then stops, because the structure is recognizable from outside while the interior keeps no consistent geometry. The guides who sell that layout price a run by where their knowledge ends."
  gm_note :complicates, "Pyre's boundary holds only under constant #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"} containment, so the cordon is worked at all hours by crews whose job is the wall rather than the wreck. A run into the periphery has to pass them before it reaches anything salvageable."

  summary "Accumulated safety failures overloaded Coremark's Pyre refinery in 2378 and began the Silent Bloom."
  prose "Pyre was a mid-drift refinery — part of #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"}'s expansion beyond its deep-Shear niche in the 2340s–2350s, at peak one of the highest-throughput plants in the Shear. It ran in an environment already past its limits: decades of unrestrained harvesting had depleted the ambient resonance ecology, and the nearby #{ref :second_span_trial, "Second Span trial"} had left an aligned guide through local space. The overload was not one dramatic failure but a cascade of small negligences — safety margins treated as obstacles, precursor readings dismissed as noise by operators who lacked the #{encyclopedia_ref :elves, "elven"} knowledge to recognize them. The refinery burned with pale resonance fire visible across the mid-drift, and the #{ref :the_silent_bloom, "Silent Bloom"} began."
