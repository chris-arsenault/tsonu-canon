  prose <<~PROSE
    Man-made reality tears. Places where the #{encyclopedia_ref :resonance, "resonance"} environment has broken so thoroughly that physics stops behaving consistently. They exist in Kaleidos orbit — in the #{ref :the_shear, "Shear"}, adjacent to ring habs, and in otherwise clean orbital space — as well as in #{ref :the_fracture, "the Fracture"}'s asteroid belt. No accepted model accounts for the full distribution.

    They are expanding slowly and require constant containment by the #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"}. They are the system's most dangerous ongoing crisis and its most productive source of new artifacts. Each artifact's properties and risks have to be established separately because no general theory predicts what a zone will produce.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :atmosphere, heading: "What They're Like"
    No two zones manifest the same way. The distortion varies with the local resonance state and the frequencies active within it.

    In some zones, walls admit light while remaining impossible to see through, and their surfaces lose a reliable boundary. In others, sound arrives from the wrong direction. Elsewhere, spatial relationships fail: a corridor that was ten meters long becomes thirty, or three. In the worst zones, even "direction" loses a stable meaning.

    #{encyclopedia_ref :resonant_tuner, "Tuners"} describe the resonance landscape inside a zone as saturated — so dense with information that signal-to-noise collapses. #{encyclopedia_ref :gnomes, "Gnomes"} are hit worst — their crystal-laced nervous systems pick up the distortion directly. #{encyclopedia_ref :fae, "Fae"} have an unexpected advantage — the spatial dislocation they manage daily is exactly the skill set the zones demand.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :atmosphere, heading: "The Cordon Line"
    From a ship, a cordon edge is nothing to look at: open space, ordinary light, the boundary invisible except near a damping buoy or a #{ref :liras_wall, "Lira's Wall"} anchor. What marks it is the sign every ship's sensors register as the line approaches — the standing broadcast that a boundary is ahead and crossing is regulated.

    The custom is to register the crossing with whichever authority holds the local cordon and receive permission before proceeding. The practice is honored unevenly. Enforcement is thin, the punishments handed out for violations are arbitrary — a warning for one crew, a seizure for the next — and the offices around the cordons carry more corruption than any other institution the Frontier maintains. People who work the boundaries say the zones eat more than space: close to the Bloom, the patience and good faith the rest of the system runs on decay first.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "Growth"
    Bloom Zones grow organically. Frontier researchers have proposed several explanations for where new zones appear: a clear line of resonance sight between two zones, constructive interference patterns, or links through frequency dimensions that conventional maps cannot represent. Each hypothesis fits some appearances and fails to predict others.

    One zone appeared beside the stable ring hab #{ref :xyloathax, "Xyloathax"} in otherwise clean orbital space in 2431. The Council now treats every inhabited orbit as a possible containment site.

    #{ref :karet_three, "Karet-3"} opened around an inhabited freight hab in the outer Shear in 2426, long after the first cascade. Its permanent station at #{ref :outside, "Outside"} is evidence that new zones can become towns as well as emergencies: contractors rotate through the cordon while evacuated families build their lives beside it.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :significance, heading: "Why the Fracture"
    The Bloom Zones near Kaleidos have known causes — #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"}'s overload at #{ref :pyre, "Pyre"} and the conductive guide left by the #{ref :second_span_trial, "Second Span trial"}. But Bloom-identical reality tears have manifested in #{ref :the_fracture, "the Fracture"}'s asteroid belt, thousands of kilometers from Kaleidos. The Fracture has its own ancient history of destruction — a shattered planet, cosmically older than the ring's collapse.

    Frontier researchers have found no shared cause that explains both groups of tears. Some argue that the two sites are connected through resonance geometry; others treat their apparent similarity as incomplete evidence. The dispute has drawn sustained concern within containment and research circles and little attention outside them.
