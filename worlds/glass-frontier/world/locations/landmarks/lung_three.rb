  prose <<~PROSE
    Lung Three is a tall ceramic chamber inside #{ref :vey, "Vey"}. Warm air enters beneath a grated floor, rises through a forest of hollow ribs, and leaves through four residential galleries. Each rib can be opened from a maintenance bridge winding through the chamber.

    Apprentices clean its shutters and compare the pull at different heights. Threads tied along the bridge show local reversals before the gauges at the gallery mouths register them. The chamber smells different at every level as training vapor separates through the flow.

    Lung Three currently carries the return displaced by the central-pump trial. Condensation has appeared on its highest bridge, where the chamber usually stays dry through the full rotation.
