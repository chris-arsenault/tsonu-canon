  prose <<~PROSE
    The Pyre cordon section where Lira Vashtenri's first full stillwater wall held. Two expansion paths met in a narrow debris gap, allowing six experimental buoys to damp the same boundary from opposite sides. The name predates the test and comes from the pale refinery dust coating the fragments there.
