  prose <<~PROSE
    A shining white filament stretches from #{ref :whitefoot, "Whitefoot"} on Kaleidos to #{ref :pelhari, "Pelhari"} and #{ref :threshold_station, "Threshold Station"}, visible to the naked eye as an impossibly thin thread against the sky. Span Nine is a pre-Glassfall hardline communication conduit, a physical connection between the surface and two off-world installations maintained across orbital distances that should make a fixed link impossible.

    The name comes from a marking at each terminus connection point. Scholars disagree on whether "Nine" marks one conduit in a numbered series, whose other eight members were destroyed, lost, or remain undiscovered, or whether the symbol is a glyph or designation from an unreadable language. Operators adopted the visible label during the Rekindling, and the name stuck without affecting the Span's use.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "How It Works"
    No surviving account explains the Span's construction, and current instruments describe its effects without supplying a mechanism.

    The filament appears to be a single continuous structure from Whitefoot to Pelhari's moon and to the Synod's station at the Lagrange point. It does not sag, stretch, or break despite the constant relative motion of these bodies. It carries signal-band #{encyclopedia_ref :resonance, "resonance"} at bandwidths that modern equipment can barely detect, providing communication capacity that dwarfs anything the post-Glassfall world has built. High-bandwidth data transfer, real-time voice, even the dense multidimensional outputs of the #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"}'s AI custodians — all of it travels the Span without degradation.

    A ship can pass through the filament without harm. The filament jumps around the hull or passes through as though the two do not occupy the same space. Purposeful interference produces a different result. A crew member who reaches for it during an EVA returns to the airlock with no memory of the attempt. A navigation system given an intercept course routes around it without instruction. A technician who tries to cut a sample discovers an hour later that they have been doing something else.

    The Span distinguishes between incidental contact and purposeful interference. The #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"} has spent decades testing that distinction without identifying its mechanism.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :significance, heading: "Significance"
    #{ref :sithari, "Sithari"} reaches the surface terminus by rail and a buried signal trunk through Whitefoot. That access gives the capital real-time links to the #{ref :clarisant, "Clarisant"} guild on #{ref :pelhari, "Pelhari"} and the Synod's custodians at #{ref :threshold_station, "Threshold Station"}, while leaving the terminus itself under Whitefoot's local operators.

    No surviving record identifies the three sites' original purpose. Whitefoot's signal yard, the Pelhari workshops, and Threshold's station all expanded around facilities that survived at the termini. Their present importance followed the Span; it does not explain why the ring builders connected those points.

    The engineering is consistent with #{encyclopedia_ref :elves, "elven"} work, though no surviving record credits them specifically. Its builders possessed capabilities the current civilization cannot approach. The filament has survived the Glassfall, #{elapsed :the_glassfall, approx: true} of orbital debris, and every attempt to study it while continuing to function perfectly. It is the most visible surviving example of Ring Age engineering that current workshops cannot reproduce.

  gm_note :appears, "Real-time conversation across the system happens only at the three termini, #{ref :whitefoot, "Whitefoot"}, #{ref :pelhari, "Pelhari"} and Threshold. Everywhere else news moves at the speed of the ship carrying it, and a party needing an answer from the far side goes to a terminus or waits."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Any deliberate move on the filament — reaching for it on EVA, cutting a sample, plotting an intercept — ends with the attempt gone rather than refused. The character comes back with an hour missing and no memory of trying, and the ship's navigation has already routed around it."
  gm_note :complicates, "Work beside the Span is harmless until it turns purposeful, and nobody can say where that line falls; the #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Synod"} has tested the distinction for decades without finding the mechanism. A crew mooring, surveying or salvaging near it gets no ruling in advance."
