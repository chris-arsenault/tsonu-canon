  prose <<~PROSE
    The abandoned Coremark refinery where #{ref :lira_vashtenri, "Lira Vashtenri"} learned deep-Shear array work. Crowncut was fixed inside a split debris mass whose two halves drew from the same local resonance field. Adjusting one processing line could move load into machinery hundreds of meters away.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "The Quiet Record"
    Other Coremark plants treated field movement as instrument error and replaced damaged arrays. Crowncut's foreman, #{ref :pera_soll, "Pera Soll"}, let Lira retune the lines according to changes she could feel before the gauges registered them. The refinery's maintenance record became an outlier: fewer failures, lower yield, and no unexplained structural losses.

    Coalition investigators found that record while searching for equipment that had survived conditions resembling the Bloom boundaries. It led them to Lira.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    Crowncut closed after Coremark's disgrace. The processing halls have been stripped, but the paired array beds remain because removing either one changes the load on the other. Compact survey teams visit to teach coupled-field inspection and leave both beds where they are.

  gm_note :triggered_by, "Cut one of the paired array beds free and the whole load moves onto the other, and the split debris mass answers hundreds of meters from the cut. #{ref :shear_compact, "Compact"} survey teams leave both beds in place for that reason and teach inspection on them."
  gm_note :appears, "Crowncut is stripped but not deserted: survey teams arrive on rotation with students and instruments to work the beds. A crew counting on an abandoned refinery has to plan around a class in session, and around what that class writes down about them."
