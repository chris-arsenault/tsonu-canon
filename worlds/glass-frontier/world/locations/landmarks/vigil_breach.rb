  prose <<~PROSE
    Vigil Breach is a ring-era doorway cut into a cliff behind the central glaciers of the #{ref :kyther_range, "Kyther Range"}. Two pale leaves meet in a vertical seam four people high. They have no handle, track, writing, or visible control. Glacial ice covers the lower half of the doorway for most of the year.

    The doors open when Kaleidos, the sun, and #{ref :threshold_station, "Threshold Station"} reach one of three recorded alignments. A low signal tone passes through the cliff first. The ice separates along the seam without melting, and the leaves draw inward. Every observed opening has ended before a party could climb from the nearest permanent shelter, so teams wait on a narrow shelf below the doors.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "The First Chamber"
    The threshold leads into a sloping chamber lined with dark plates. Its floor is dry even when meltwater runs over the outer doors. A second doorway stands at the lower end. That door begins to open only after the outer leaves start closing, leaving too little time for a roped party to reach it and return.

    Surveyors have removed loose pieces from the slope without cutting the chamber. Some are mountain crystal carrying ringglass dust. Others are thin, worked strips that remain the same temperature in snow, sunlight, and a heated case. The #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"} records their signal response; the #{ref :clarisant, "Clarisant"} tests their effect on structural fields. Neither institution has identified their use.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    The ice shelf used for the last three opening watches has split from the cliff and moved downslope. Kyther guides have marked a new shelf farther west, beyond a band of snow that fails the sounding-post test. The Synod wants instruments placed there before the next alignment. The guides will carry them only after the unstable slab is cut free, even if that means missing the opening.

    Traders remain in the lower shelters with heated cases and offers for anything brought out. The valley councils prohibit sale until a surveyor has logged an object and a guide has confirmed where it was found.

  gm_note :appears, "Nobody arrives at an opening; everybody waits for one, camped on a narrow shelf below the doors alongside Synod observers, guides, and traders holding the same forecast. Once the low tone runs through the cliff, anyone still down at the permanent shelter has missed it."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Push for the second doorway and the timing decides it: the inner door only begins to open once the outer leaves have started closing. Crossing is a decision to be shut in, and the rope will not stretch to cover both moves."
  gm_note :complicates, "Traders wait in the lower shelters with heated cases and standing offers for anything carried out, but no sale is lawful until a surveyor logs the object and a guide confirms the find spot. A piece sold around that is a piece no shelter in the range will handle again."
