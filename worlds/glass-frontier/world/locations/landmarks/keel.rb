  prose <<~PROSE
    The system's primary trade lane — an orbital route connecting #{encyclopedia_ref :ringglass, "ringglass"} production zones in #{ref :the_shear, "The Shear"}, major refinement facilities, #{ref :sithari, "Sithari"}, and #{ref :ashvane, "Ashvane"} at the far end. It remains the single most important corridor for bulk commerce in the Kaleidos system.

    The name comes from its shape on a navigation chart — a long central spine with subsidiary routes branching off like ribs. A ship on the Keel is following the spine. A ship heading to a secondary destination peels off at one of the branch points.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :geography, heading: "Geography"
    The Keel is not a road. It's a corridor through orbital space — a navigable path through the ring, skirting Shear zones, connecting the major nodes where things are produced, refined, and consumed. The route threads between ring habs, passes through managed Shear corridors where debris has been cleared or stabilized, and includes several transition points between orbital and surface-access zones.

    Key nodes along the Keel:
    - **Shear production zones** — where #{encyclopedia_ref :ratters, "Ratters"} and industrial operations harvest raw ringglass from the debris field
    - **Refinement habs** — ring habs that specialize in cutting, tuning, and processing ringglass from aggregate to refined grade
    - **#{ref :keelward, "Keelward"}** — Sithari's surface terminal, where freight enters the financial and regulatory center
    - **#{ref :ashvane, "Ashvane"}** — the far terminus; an inhabited moon whose Shadewell port anchors the route's other end

    Transit time end-to-end depends on the vessel. A fast courier makes it in days. A heavy cargo hauler takes weeks. Navigation, shelter, rescue, and fuel are maintained in sections by carriers, ports, guilds, cooperatives, and public route services. No organization keeps the whole corridor.

    #{ref :hinge_six, "Hinge Six"} joins the inner and outer route records where traffic turns toward Korvath and Ashvane. The #{ref :pell_freight_assembly, "Pell Freight Assembly"} keeps #{ref :cold_lantern, "Cold Lantern"} on its claim approaches. At the surface terminals, #{ref :fourth_bell_house, "Fourth Bell House"} receives stranded passengers in Keelward and #{ref :south_shade, "South Shade"} fits road crews into Shadewell's port schedule. Other waystops belong to hab councils, family carriers, rescue pools, and settlements whose names matter chiefly on the branch they keep.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :economy, heading: "Economy"
    What moves on the Keel:

    **Ringglass** — raw, refined, and intact. The Keel exists because ringglass needs to get from where it's mined to where it's used, and every settlement in the system uses it. Bulk aggregate moves in heavy haulers. Refined product moves under escort. Intact pieces move under heavy escort, and the security premium is a significant fraction of the cargo's value.

    **Manufactured goods.** Resonance-integrated technology manufactured in ring habs — everything from household lanterns to kite components. The ring habs have the skilled labor and the ringglass access. The surface has the population and the demand.

    **Microcavities.** Sealed ringglass fuel cells flowing from processing facilities to consumption points. A steady, unglamorous trade that underpins everything else.

    **People.** Passenger traffic on the Keel is substantial. Workers, merchants, migrants, tourists. #{ref :vantara, "Vantara"} runs scheduled service along the full route. Hab carriers, port cooperatives, independent vessels, and local lines carry shorter legs and feed the main departures.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :dangers, heading: "Dangers"
    The Keel is contested and portions are dangerous.

    **Pirates.** The route's economic importance makes it a target. Independent raiders and organized criminal operations — including #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"} remnants — hit convoys in the gaps between patrolled segments. #{ref :vantara, "Vantara"}'s armed escorts deter casual piracy. Determined or well-equipped pirates are a different matter.

    **Bloom Zones.** Several #{ref :bloom_zones, "Bloom Zones"} sit near or intersect with Keel branch routes. Reality distortion from an active zone can disrupt navigation, damage resonance equipment, and — in extreme cases — render a corridor impassable. The #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"} maintains containment cordons, but the zones are expanding slowly and the Keel's geometry may need to shift.

    **The Shear.** Sections of the Keel pass through managed Shear corridors — areas where debris has been cleared but the resonance environment is still distorted. These segments require Shear-rated vessels and careful navigation. Drift events can close a corridor without warning.

    **Lawlessness.** Portions of the Keel are far enough from any settlement or hab to be effectively ungoverned. The #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"}'s jurisdiction is theoretical in these zones. Disputes are settled by the parties involved, which sometimes means negotiation and sometimes means something else.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Tensions"
    Control of the Keel has been contested since it was established. During the Contested Reach, route segments changed hands three times. The Bitter Reach added new grievances. The Accord era has stabilized most of the route, but "most" is not "all."

    The fundamental tension is economic: the Keel is too valuable for anyone to control exclusively and too important for anyone to ignore. Vantara maintains a large beacon and station network without controlling the municipal terminals, guild markers, cooperative rescue posts, or independent receiving ports around it. #{ref :sithari, "Sithari"} regulates the financial layer but can't police the corridor. The #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} has jurisdiction over Shear segments but not the open-space portions. The result is a patchwork of overlapping authorities, gaps between them, and people who make their living in those gaps.

  log "2026-08-20 — Replaced the single-carrier account of Keel services with named municipal, cooperative, guild, and carrier facilities. Vantara keeps a large network but does not own the route's accommodation, rescue, or receiving infrastructure."

  gm_note :appears, "Beacons, fuel, shelter and rescue on the Keel are kept in sections, and the section changes at every branch point. A tow arranged on one leg is a stranger's favor on the next, with different rates, different paperwork and a different idea of who is liable."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Ask who to take a grievance to after something happens in open corridor and you get a list of overlapping authorities rather than an answer. Accord jurisdiction out there is theoretical, and the parties are expected to settle it between themselves."
  gm_note :complicates, "Carrying intact ringglass turns any leg into a convoy problem: the escort premium runs to a serious fraction of the crate's value, and the unpatrolled gaps between segments are exactly where raiders wait for cargo worth that much."
