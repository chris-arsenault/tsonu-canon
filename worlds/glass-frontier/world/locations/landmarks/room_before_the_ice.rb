  prose <<~PROSE
    This thaw has exposed a complete apartment inside the Fourth Column, furnished with Ring Age chairs and a sealed interior door. The thawglass frame passes through its walls as though the room stood there before the column grew. Mera has diverted the next spill channel around it.

    The diversion sends one water ward's garden share through another ward's public column. Both have filed claims before the apartment finishes melting free: one for the lost spring flow, the other for the room now occupying its frame. The bright-season market has moved onto the surrounding stairs, where ward readers post the falling water level beside each claim.
