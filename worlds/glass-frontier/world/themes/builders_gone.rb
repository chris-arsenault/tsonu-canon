    *The tension between inheritance and reinvention.*

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :description, heading: "The System"
    The ring's resonance systems were engineered by the elves. The origin of the ambient phenomenon remains unestablished. Ringglass was shaped by elven science. The ring was elven architecture. The elves are gone. What remains is an inheritance nobody fully understands — and a civilization that keeps building anyway, from fragments, approximations, and improvisation that sometimes produces things the original builders never imagined.

    The band/bandwidth model is the mechanical expression. Broad bandwidth is accessible to everyone. Mid bandwidth requires training. Narrow bandwidth is where the elves operated and where nobody else goes safely. The entire technological civilization runs on the broad and mid range of a system designed for narrow. The Bloom happened in the gap between what was built and what is understood.

    But the Tuners — who reinvented resonance practice without elven theory — sometimes understand local conditions better than the original science would have predicted. The Synod's rituals are superstition-as-engineering, and they work. New builders emerge. New approaches appear.

    This is not just loss. The tension has a genuine other side:

    - The Tuners didn't recover elven science — they built something new. Folk Tuning works in ways the Clarisant's academic approach can't replicate, precisely because it wasn't derived from the original framework.
    - The Synod communicates with god-tier AIs through trial-and-error rituals. Their understanding is shallow but their results are real.
    - Communities that survived the Famine by improvising developed capabilities that planned systems wouldn't have produced.

    The question isn't "how do we get back what was lost" — it's "what do we make from here." Both inheritance and reinvention are real. The tension between them is productive.

    The tension appears when people must choose between restoring an inherited design and making something suited to their present lives. A craftworker may value an old method while wanting to make a different object; a community may keep its buildings and change the purposes they serve. Loss and reinvention shape the cases above. Other work continues through teaching, practice and new ambitions without a break in its inheritance.
