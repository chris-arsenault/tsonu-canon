  prose <<~PROSE
    *Pale Catch* cycles between #{ref :keelward, "Keelward"}, #{ref :ladderwell, "Ladderwell"}, and the Kyther landing fields. The #{ref :prismwell_kite_guild, "Prismwell Kite Guild"} maintains its shower cloth and broad steppe skids so the same craft can cross exposed surface routes and climb to the inner fields.

    The flitter settles into its berth frame after landing and holds its doors until the pad lights fall together. In a depleted field it descends on stored charge and waits; the craft remains sound while nobody aboard can name a departure time.

  gm_note :appears, "Pale Catch is the Prismwell craft assigned when a route crosses both a surface landing and Keelward's inner fields."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "When its beacons and hull compass disagree, it refuses the leg until someone takes manual control and owns the route departure."
  gm_note :complicates, "After landing, the residual correction holds the doors shut; forcing the cabin open transfers that last motion into the first object touched."
