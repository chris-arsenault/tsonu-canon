  descriptive_identity(
    appearance: "A broad timber hull over pale Ninth Kiln ribs, with a low lamp hung on either side and sockets for " \
                "removable shelters, cargo rails, and flood pumps.",
    aboard: "The deck house holds household bunks, a stove, route tallies, and a dry locker. Passengers and cargo " \
            "share whatever deck remains after the current season's fittings are secured.",
    behavior: "Low Lamp sounds every approach with a metal-shod pole, settles onto mud when a channel closes, and " \
              "backs away until its pilot finds the next registered depth or tow point."

  prose <<~PROSE
    *Low Lamp* works the changing channels between Dovra's water boards and #{ref :lowbank, "Lowbank"}. Its household shifts the deck between freight, passenger, and flood work without changing the shallow hull. The vessel's pale ceramic ribs came from #{ref :ninth_kiln, "Ninth Kiln"}; damaged ribs are replaced before planking because the river's broad iron response otherwise pulls through the fittings.

    The barge takes the long landing at #{ref :the_reed_door, "the Reed Door"}. Its pilot leaves both sounding poles beside the house board while the crew exchanges route marks, loads kiln goods, or waits for a water board to reopen the western passage.

  gm_note :appears, "Low Lamp takes passengers when its household has deck space, and the fare is as often return carriage, repair tile, or a share of the load as coin."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "A posted opening does not stop the pilot from sounding the approach; silt and pole-thieves can change a channel after the notice leaves."
  gm_note :complicates, "A water board can call Low Lamp into flood service with its hired cargo still aboard, leaving every private journey waiting on the board's release."
