  summary "The Empty Bearing is the suspected hushmaw reported across three Deep Shear pockets along claim crews' return courses. Recovered membrane repeats one ship's drive-start tone near tuned ringglass."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Claim crews working beyond the Pell routes have reported the same empty bearing across three separate Deep pockets. The direction changes when plotted against ordinary space and remains fixed when plotted against each crew's return course. One ship lost its survey tune. Another abandoned a cutter. The third returned with a strip of clear membrane caught under an exterior line guide.

    The Shear Compact has issued a shared warning without declaring one animal responsible. Deep-runners have begun varying their retreat checks and carrying two decoy resonators. The recovered membrane continues to repeat a weak version of the third ship's drive-start tone when placed near tuned ringglass.

  gm_note :appears, "A clean gap returns on the crew's own retreat bearing rather than at one fixed position in ordinary space. Three claim crews have reported it, and the Compact has not declared whether they met one animal."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Repeated active checks strengthen the path a #{encyclopedia_ref :hushmaw, "hushmaw"} follows. Deep-runners vary their retreat checks and carry two decoy resonators after the Empty Bearing appears."
  gm_note :complicates, "The recovered membrane still repeats the third ship's drive-start tone near tuned ringglass, so testing the only physical evidence reproduces the signal that drew the animal."
