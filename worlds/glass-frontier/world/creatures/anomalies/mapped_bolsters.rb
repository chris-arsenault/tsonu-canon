  summary "The Mapped Bolsters are the populations whose grazing grounds, cast-shell yields, and structural loads appear on Ratter claim maps. Their movements can change which debris is safe to cut."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Ratter claim maps record known #{encyclopedia_ref :bolsters, "bolster"} grazing grounds, the cast-shell yield collected from each, and debris the animals may be helping to hold together. A few dozen can move across one mass over years, smoothing unstable crystal growth and leaving plate behind.

    Their departure can reveal that the population had become part of what held the site together. Crews therefore mark the animals before cutting and update the map when a grazing ground shifts, thins, or begins answering survey pulses through every shell.

  gm_note :appears, "A claim map marks both the cast-shell yield and the debris the local population may be carrying, so moving animals change the work boundary."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Taking plate from a living animal makes a mapped ground sparse and leaves its debris failing more often; repeated live cutting is recorded as damage to the claim."
  gm_note :complicates, "A population can make a site safer while it feeds and leave the same mass unsupported when it moves on."
