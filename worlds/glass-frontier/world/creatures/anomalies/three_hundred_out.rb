    appearance: "An opaque pale-grey shell holding about three hundred meters beyond Outside, with hair-fine filaments drifting across the Karet wall array's gradient.",
    behavior: "It remains oriented toward the wall array and changes its path after recalibration; permanent residents mark its position beside the daily cordon readings.",
    threat: "Its trailing filaments can reach tuned mounts from well beyond the distance at which the animal itself appears dangerous, leaving the ringglass out of calibration for hours."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Three Hundred Out is the first rind recorded beside an active Bloom cordon. It holds about three hundred meters from #{ref :outside, "Outside"}, between the boundary walk and the visible edge of #{ref :karet_three, "Karet-3"}. Its path changes when the wall array recalibrates.

    Council teams are preparing a series of counter-tones to draw it back toward the Deep Shear. The station's permanent residents watch from the maintenance bay and mark its daily position beside the cordon readings.

  gm_note :appears, "Three Hundred Out arrives wherever the local array holds a steady tone. Cutting the source makes it circle outward hunting the line, spreading its filaments across more of the cordon."
  gm_note :complicates, "Its filaments trail well beyond the shell, so the animal can remain at its familiar distance while a strand pulls one tuned mount out of calibration for hours."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Shooting it scatters the filaments. Council crews instead place a counter-tone beyond the route they want it to follow, which needs a clear field and hours the cordon may not have."
