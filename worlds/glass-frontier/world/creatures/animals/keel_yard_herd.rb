  prose <<~PROSE
    A large herd has settled below #{ref :shadewell, "Shadewell"}'s outer cargo yard after a damaged cold-store return began warming the subgrade. The first animals entered through a storm drain. Young now occupy the culvert behind the Keel lift's secondary radiator bank.

    Port workers cannot seal the drain until the young are moved and cannot run the radiator at full load while adults crowd its exhaust shade. Highland handlers have built a screened path toward an unused quarry. The herd leaves the path whenever the cold-store pumps start, following the buried return toward the yard again.
