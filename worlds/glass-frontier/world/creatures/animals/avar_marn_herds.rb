  prose <<~PROSE
    Herding families move #{encyclopedia_ref :marn, "marn"} between ridge shelter and open grass as water and road conditions change across #{ref :avar, "Avar"}. A family may keep a few animals beside a farm or move several hundred between seasonal camps. Public well orders name livestock basins explicitly, and herd allotments shift to outlying shafts during shortages.

    Ownership marks identify a household and season on horn sheaths that shed as the animal matures. Breeding loans, wool, young stock, and future water access create obligations that travel between wells and can outlast the animals that created them. #{ref :ladderwell, "Ladderwell"} receives the largest exchange of herds, wool, pack traffic, and machinery on the eastern steppe.

  gm_note :appears, "A market or wayhouse pen holds several household herds whose marks, water allotments, and next stops all differ, even when the animals will travel together."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "A whole herd refusing the same ground moves the caravan; route keepers still require an instrument survey before they change the road's status."
  gm_note :complicates, "Breeding loans and water access travel with the herds, so returning one lost animal can reopen an obligation between households at different wells."
