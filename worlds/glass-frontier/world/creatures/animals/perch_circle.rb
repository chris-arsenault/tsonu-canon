  prose <<~PROSE
    During the current #{encyclopedia_ref :sarn, "sarn"} passage, one herd crossed Perch's far fragment along the recorded route. The other entered a widening circle around the settlement and began shedding combs at every turn.

    The animals keep a stable formation and retain the young near the center. Their repeated circuit carries them through every marked collection band. Perch closes approach lanes as the herd tightens and sends low collection craft beneath the field rather than through it.
  PROSE

  gm_note :appears, "The herd turns up in a lane the charts show as clear, and Perch closes the approach before a crossing vessel sees the spiral."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "A vessel entering the spiral becomes another load in the exchange and is passed toward the outer edge faster than its kite can cancel the turn."
  gm_note :complicates, "Every circuit sheds valuable combs through all the marked collection bands, giving every ward a reason to claim the widening circle should be read in its favor."
