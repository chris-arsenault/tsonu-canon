  prose <<~PROSE
    Khars are low, six-legged animals native to Ashvane's volcanic highlands. Adults carry overlapping black plates across the spine and a fringe of pale insulating fibers around the belly. They spend direct light in caves, culverts, and deep rock shade, then emerge during giant-shade and after sunset to graze fungi, salt growth, and the tough plants around seep lines.

    Settlements tolerate small groups near outer drains because they clear growth from warm channels and warn of changing heat below the ground. A herd inside a radiator yard can break pipework, foul vents, and force a cooling shutdown during the part of the cycle when the system has nowhere else to send its load.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :biology, heading: "Heat Under the Plates"
    A khar's dorsal plates stand away from the body on short vascular stems. In cool shade, blood warms beneath the dark surface. As the animal heats, the plates lift and expose the pale tissue between them. The moving air carries heat away before it reaches the insulated belly.

    The front feet end in broad scraping claws. Rear feet carry smaller pads sensitive to temperature changes in stone. An animal can follow a buried warm line through a basalt shelf and distinguish flowing water from a dry pipe by the way the heat moves. Herds use that sense to find seeps and caves with stable night temperatures.

    Khars store water in dense tissue along the flanks and drink heavily when a source appears. They will break a brittle condensate pipe after tracing it below ground. Intact metal usually defeats them; ceramic joints, old sealant, and cooling cloth do not.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Around Settlements"
    Ashvane towns paint exposed utility lines with a bitter mineral wash. The taste discourages adults and must be renewed after dust storms. Low fences redirect moving herds without trapping them against a hot wall. A frightened khar digs toward cooler ground, even when the nearest cool ground lies beneath a house floor.

    Radiator crews watch for lifted plates at night. A whole herd opening its back while standing in shade indicates a warm pulse below the yard. The animals may have found a leaking return before pressure instruments register the loss. Workers clear the herd, close the line, and inspect the route from the first disturbed soil.

    Heat-road haulers carry folding screens to keep khars away from warm hubs during overnight stops. The animals gather behind a parked vehicle for shade and remain when the drive begins warming. Drivers walk the full chassis before departure rather than trusting motion to scatter them.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :trade, heading: "Plate and Fiber"
    Khars shed outer plate layers in thin curved scales. Ground scales become dark heat-absorbing pigment. Whole pieces line solar cookers, instrument shelters, and the warm side of public doors. The pale belly fiber is short, difficult to spin, and useful as loose insulation inside gloves and pipe wraps.

    Highland households keep half-domesticated groups near fungi beds. The animals return for salt and shade while retaining their seasonal range. Ownership marks go on bells and neck cords because the plates shed. A marked animal that follows a wild herd may return after the hot season or join another household's shade yard.

    Meat enters local markets after herd culls and utility removals. Hunters approach from the cool side of a group and avoid driving animals across active lines. A stampede over buried cooling cloth can turn a routine cull into a town repair.
  PROSE

  cue "At dusk a heat-road stop fills with low black shapes easing out of the culverts, and before the drivers eat they walk slowly around every hauler, crouching to look under each axle with a hand lamp."
  cue "Town doorways in the highlands are framed on the sunward side with curved black scales, and the utility pipes running past them are streaked chalky white where the bitter wash was last brushed on."
  affordance "A herd standing in shade with every back plate lifted is reading a warm pulse below the ground. Radiator crews take it as a leaking return that pressure instruments have not registered yet and dig from the first disturbed soil."
  pressure "A frightened khar digs toward cooler ground instead of running, even when the cool ground lies under a house floor. Its claws go through ceramic joints, old sealant, and cooling cloth, so a herd scattered by noise ends as a floor repair."
  variation "Shade-yard khars kept by highland households beside their fungi beds are smaller and slower to dig, wear bells, and come to a shaken salt pouch; wild herds range the seep lines in groups of forty or more and scatter at a stranger's smell."
  variation "Drain khars, tolerated for generations along the outer drains of town cooling works, lift their plates at the faintest warm pulse, and yard crews trade young from a sharp-sensing line the way other towns trade good dogs."
