  prose <<~PROSE
    The cold routes — the ice roads of Lithren's approaches, the shadowed legs of the outer runs — carry a sleeping cargo. Halos lie in the ice as a gray dust, mineral-shelled and patient on a scale surveys measure in generations, and they wake to one thing: the sustained working tone of a navigation lamp. Around a burning route lamp the ice flowers. Pale fans, ribbed and translucent as scraped horn, rise in a tight ring at the exact radius the lamp's tone carries, grow while the lamp speaks, and rest when it goes dark.

    Each period of growth leaves a ring. On continuously occupied routes, crews can compare those rings with recorded seasons of lamp service, including weak growth during the Famine. A dormant interval leaves no ring of its own, so counting growth cannot measure how long an abandoned lamp stood dark.

    The #{ref :lithren, "ring-era lamps identified on Lithren in 2331"} carry old mineralized fans separated from younger growth by a weathered surface. Relighting began the younger layers. Some modern waystations preserve the old fans around working replacements; others use wholly new posts. The ancient colonies establish earlier lamp use without providing an unbroken account of travel through the Famine.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Fouling and the Stranded Camp"
    Working lamps need clearing. A well-served lamp post buries itself — the fans crowd to the tone's radius and shade the light they woke to — so the maintenance round scrapes the season's growth, and the scrapings go home as trade stock: fan horn cuts into pale translucent sheet for lamp shades and instrument windows, and the route posts sell their scrapings by the sack. Clearing custom leaves the oldest ring standing, partly for the record, partly because a bare post reads as an abandoned route to any crew sighting it from distance.

    Navigation lamps are the usual sustained tone, but heaters and instruments can also wake halos. A crew running equipment through a cold night may wake inside a young flowering. Patrols log every fan ring found off the marked road as evidence of an earlier camp or unlisted route.
  PROSE

  cue "Around the route lamp the ice has flowered — a tight ring of pale ribbed fans at exactly the radius the tone carries — and the newest growth is still translucent enough to show the light through."
  cue "The waystation's lamp post rises from a colony generations deep, and the maintenance path spirals through the old growth like a walk through an orchard."
  affordance "Compare growth with dated lamp service to identify periods of strong or weak use; an old dead colony can reveal a landing whose beacon no longer shines. Unmeasured dormancy prevents a ring count from dating the whole route."
  pressure "A working lamp needs a clearing rota as the fans crowd its light. Equipment used through a cold night may also leave a fan ring that marks the camp for later patrols."
  variation "Lithren's monument colonies are curated with walkways and left to bury their dead lamps whole; the working routes scrape yearly and sell fan horn by the sack."
  variation "Some outer crews plant a lamp over halo-rich ice and farm the fans; route records distinguish those regular harvest rings from colonies around navigation lamps."
