  summary "Lanterns are long-limbed debris-field anomalies that soften solid surfaces with a cold luminous lure, then draw small dense objects through them. Wild animals hold fishing grounds in deep wrecks; salvage handlers work with collared lanterns from skiffs."
  origin "Documented only in the deep debris fields; the first survey crews named them for the repeated casting, waiting, and drawing behavior they observed"
  biology "A slow, long-limbed climber the size of a folded coat, mostly dark; one limb ends in the lantern — a lure of cold light it dips against solid surfaces, which soften under the glow to take the lure through"
  resonance_relation "The lantern emits a narrow structural-band signal outside the visible spectrum, and solid surfaces within it behave briefly and locally like still water"
  principal_accommodation "Handler custom collars working lanterns at the throat-limb, sized so small catch passes to the animal while large catch waits at the surface for the hand"

  prose <<~PROSE
    A lantern is a dark, long-limbed climber about the size of a folded coat. Wild animals hold territories among the rails, spars, and enclosed holds of deep wrecks. At a fishing site the animal hangs above a surface, lowers the cold light at the end of one limb, and waits. Under that narrow structural-band emission, plating moves in slow rings and yields like deep mud. The lantern draws a small dense object through the softened patch, which closes seamless behind the catch, then carries it to a sheltered cache. Repeated use leaves no opening, but sorted piles around a resting place reveal a long-used ground.

    Lanterns choose surfaces above occupied voids and pass over vacuum, using a through-plate sense that instruments have not reproduced. Handlers wait for that site choice. A lantern rides the skiff's rail on a leash and wears a collar around the throat-limb: the smallest catch passes to the animal, while a larger object stops at the softened surface for the handler's gloved hand. Regular pairs recognize one another and work poorly after an abrupt transfer, so handling knowledge and individual animals often remain with one household. Claim law assigns a surfaced object to the claim covering the plate it came through.
  PROSE

  cue "Night salvage: the skiff's rail carries three leashed lanterns, the first is slipped over the wreck's flank, and its cold lure settles against a hold plate the charts mark sealed — which begins, under the glow, to move in slow rings."
  cue "The catch comes up through the closing metal — an instrument core, dense and small — and the collar stops it at the surface for the handler's glove under claim law."
  affordance "A handled lantern retrieves from the one place salvage cannot reach — the sealed voids — choosing productive ground by a sense better than charts, for the price of a collar, a leash, and the lantern's small-catch keep."
  variation "Skiff crews run two to five collared lanterns on night rounds; the few big yard partnerships keep lantern lines bred to the work across generations, and their collars are heirloom tackle."
  variation "Wild lanterns keep the full catch in sheltered caches. Long-used wreck grounds become depleted of small dense objects near the surfaces the animals can reach."
