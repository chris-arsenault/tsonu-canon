  summary "Ricochets are cat-sized gallery hunters whose coiled tails bank kinetic charge as they run. They spend the charge in one flat, straight leap across an open span, with a low tail hum warning that a leap is ready."

  prose <<~PROSE
    A ricochet is a cat-sized gallery climber with gripping feet, heavy shoulders, and a coiled tail that banks kinetic-band charge while the animal runs. As the bank fills, the tail hums at a low audible pitch. The ricochet spends the charge in a flat, straight leap across open gallery space, lands already running, and begins charging again. The distance depends on how long it ran beforehand.

    Ricochets hold territories across several gallery levels. They hunt vermin along ducts and warm service runs, leave scent at the ends of habitual leap lines, and defend den recesses with teeth before spending a charged leap to escape. Hab traffic learns those routes: a humming ceiling clears the likely line, and maintenance crews leave exits open around a cornered animal. Old ricochets become known by scars and by the spans they use.

    The leap is straight enough for riggers to sight along a habitual route when checking a rail, but this is a borrowed use of hunting and travel behavior. The animals also go quiet before kinetic dead spells: tails slacken, hunting stops, and ricochets stay near their dens. Crews compare that gallery-wide change with their instruments and re-check suspended loads.

    Modern carriers have brought kept ricochets to enclosed outer-system camps, including Lithren's excavation shelters. There they live on vermin and supplied meat within heated breathable air. A connected service sleeve can extend their territory between shelters. An open cold gap ends it: the animal needs a pressure carrier for travel beyond the enclosures. A charged leap near thin canopy material makes frightening one out of a hiding place particularly dangerous.
  PROSE

  cue "The ceiling over the gallery junction hums its low note, foot traffic clears the habitual line, and the ricochet takes the span in one flat stroke, landing already silent and running."
  cue "The old tom crosses its habitual span; the rigger sights along the leap, sees the rail sag below it, and sends for shims."
  affordance "Ricochets keep the galleries' vermin down, their leap lines give the trades a free straightedge, and their going-quiet before kinetic dead spells is early warning the habs have learned to read."
  variation "Gallery ricochets hold indoor territories and hum through charged weather; the dock-country populations bank bigger in the traffic's kinetic wash, and their spans are the ones the children's bets get serious about."
  variation "The old toms' habitual lines become fixtures — named, sighted along, walked around — and a hab whose famous line goes unused for a season knows its ricochet's territory has changed hands before any trap or census does."
