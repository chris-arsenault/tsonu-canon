  name "Imprints"
  summary "Imprints are body-copying anomalies of the Fracture and the Ashenmaw approaches: forearm-length feeders whose reflective skin takes the shape of the last warm body held against it and keeps the shape until the imprint feeds. Salvage crews read a copied face on a hull as a record of who rested there."

  prose <<~PROSE
    In the Fracture's cold reaches and along the Ashenmaw approaches, salvage crews check reflective patches on the warm side of a wreck. An imprint at rest is a forearm-length oval of poured-mirror skin. After feeding, its skin holds a shallow silvered relief of the warm body pressed against it — the cheek and closed eye of a sleeper, or the splayed fingers of a braced hand. The copy persists until the imprint feeds again.

    Survey instruments measure the copy below the skin. It reproduces the body's mass distribution in miniature and holds a faint structural-band echo of the original. Crew logs from separate decades compare the vibration under a bare hand to a struck tuning fork. Dissections support two incompatible anatomies at the organ level, and neither model accounts for the copied mass distribution.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Imprint Country Rules"
    The working rules are old Shear economy. Berths in imprint country get a light and a check, because the drain reads as cold gear to a tired sleeper and the morning weakness has been mistaken for flu with poor results. Silvered surfaces get a stick before a hand. And copies get read before they get scraped: a fresh face in the silver is a record — someone rested here since the last feed — and salvage courts have accepted imprint copies as evidence of presence twice, both times over loud objection, both times upheld.

    Collectors buy settled imprints carrying clear copies, and wreck-divers sell them with provenance accounts. A copy matched to a named person carries a higher quoted price than an unidentified face.
  PROSE

  cue "On the warm side of the wreck a patch of hull shines wrong, and closer, the shine resolves into the shallow silvered relief of a sleeping face."
  cue "The old hand runs a stick along the silvered seam before anyone berths, and two flattened ovals detach and pour themselves unhurriedly into the dark."
  affordance "A copied skin is a record: proof someone rested at this wreck since the imprint's last feed, detailed enough to redirect a search — and the band echo in a fresh copy gives instruments a trace of the original to match."
  pressure "Crews light and probe a berth before use, then read any copy before removing the imprint. A named face may redirect a search or turn the settled animal into evidence."
  variation "Fracture imprints run large and patient and cluster on inhabited wrecks; the Ashenmaw approach population is smaller, quicker to feed, and copies with cruder detail the dissection literature argues about."
  variation "Two anatomies circulate in the survey literature, both drawn from dissected specimens and disagreeing at the organ level; new reports record which model each organ supports."
