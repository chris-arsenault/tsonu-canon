  prose <<~PROSE
    A knot is a smooth gray pipe dweller about as long as a forearm. It moves through wet mains and household runs, grazing film at cleanouts and resting in junction boxes where several flows meet. The skin reads pressure and vibration across the whole body. At the flutter of a leak or the chatter of a loose joint, the knot wraps around the fault and clamps its gripping hide against the pipe.

    The animal holds until the line again carries its full working-pressure signature. A plumber repairs the joint with the knot in place, then opens the valves; if pressure stabilizes, it releases and resumes its route. Test benches confirm that incomplete repairs remain clamped. A deliberate pressure change requires acclimating the animal to the new signature or relocating it.

    Ravel plumbing offices count animals by run and inspect their feeding points. Households place scraps at accessible cleanouts, leave junction routes open, and often know long-resident knots by their markings. Morning rounds check those junctions for a dark, tightened body. The oldest named animals appear in water-office registries with the stretches they patrol and the clamps recorded there.
  PROSE

  cue "The morning round finds the junction box's knot wrapped tight around the elbow joint, hide flushed dark — the day's work list, written in animal — and the plumber sets out tools beside a colleague already on the job."
  cue "The last valve opens, the line comes up to pressure, and the knot loosens as the water sings right — the repair passed by the one inspector on the system that cannot be argued with."
  affordance "A stocked water run gains a mobile leak response: faults found by flow, held stable until repair, and released when the line returns to full pressure."
  variation "System knots patrol the mains under the water offices' registry; household runs keep their own known animals; and the great named knots — decades clamped and counted — carry the standing the fragments give their working elders."
  variation "Release standards vary with the water — high-pressure industrial lines breed harder-skinned knots with stricter songs — and the trades' bench lore about which stretch's animals pass what work is, functionally, the hab's real inspection code."
