  name "Aulm"
  summary "Aulm are translucent, slow-moving cultivated organisms that graze spills, refuse, and loose sealant along fixed corridor routes in sealed habitats. They are the surviving sanitation stock of the intact ring, keeping the circuits they followed when the ring was whole, and habs build around them."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Ring fragments with surviving sanitation stock keep aulm circuits through their corridors. An aulm is a knee-high mass of firm translucent tissue that moves at a pace a person overtakes at a stroll, grazing spilled food, refuse, mold, and degraded sealant. Intact-ring maintenance registers list each circuit and feeding schedule beside pumps and filters, and the aulm in Carom's galleries descend from that stock.

    Since the Glassfall the aulm have kept their own schedule. The circuits they walk are older than the break, laid down in a marker compound the ring painted into its decks, and they cut across today's settlements on the ring's old logic. Habs have grown around their aulm the way a road grows around a river crossing: refuse points sit on the route, bunkrooms sit off it, and a corridor the route crosses gets a raised sill and a painted warning, because an aulm stopped by new construction stands against the obstacle and grazes the same span of wall until the wall needs replacing.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :naming, heading: "The Register Word"
    The old maintenance registers head each circuit's page with a long elven word for the stock. Hab speech kept its first syllable. *Aulm* is both one animal and many, a corridor an aulm walks is an aulm route, and a hab with no living stock on a circuit posts it as *bare*.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Living on the Route"
    The working rules are old and short. Set waste on the route and it is gone by shift-end. Keep bedding, cargo, and animals off the route, because an aulm takes an outflung hand for a spill and its digestion burns like strong lye. Feed an aulm at its refuse points only: an aulm drawn off its line rejoins the circuit at the nearest marker facing whichever way it happens to face, and an aulm re-walking a buried line goes through floorboards, cold stores, and nursery walls with the same patience it gives a corridor.

    A stopped aulm prompts an air and temperature check. They stall where the air runs wrong and thin or slow when a hab grows cold. A dead aulm is cut from its route and the circuit posted as bare until a neighboring hab can spare a young one, carried over in a lined crate with its feeding schedule written on the lid.
  PROSE

  cue "A translucent mass the height of a child's knee pours itself along the corridor wall a little slower than a stroll, and foot traffic parts around it with every head bent to its own business."
  cue "Refuse stands in open pans along one edge of the gallery, set out to a schedule everyone seems to know, and the pans nearest the junction are already empty and clean."
  affordance "An aulm route is reliable disposal — anything organic left on the line is gone by shift-end — and a stopped or thinning aulm is an early warning about the hab's air or heat that runs ahead of the instruments."
  pressure "The route treats a sleeper as refuse, and an aulm drawn off its circuit by careless feeding re-walks the original line through whatever has been built across it since."
  variation "Established habs raise sills and paint warnings where routes cross living space; newer settlements on old fragments discover their routes one burned bedroll at a time."
  variation "Some galleries feed their aulm heavily at refuse points for a fast circuit; others keep a leaner animal whose slower circuit covers the off-shift."
