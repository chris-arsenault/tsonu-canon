  summary "Khar mimics are hot-country anomalies that take a khar's plates, gait, and place within a shade cluster while reading as loose ash and excess heat to instruments. Herders identify them by a second count and leave the extra animal undisturbed."
  origin "Noted in Ashvane highland surveys from the early Rekindling onward, without a dated first sighting; some herding families hold that it arrived with the Silent Bloom, decades after those first survey notes"
  biology "Reads as a khar to the eye at a distance and to instruments as a standing thermal anomaly with the mass reading of loose ash; herders report it standing, shuffling and leaving, and a survey bounty for a carcass has stood unclaimed since 2398"
  resonance_relation "Sits wrong in the band — a herd cluster with a mimic in it reads one voice too many to a tuner, the extra voice arriving a half-beat late"

  prose <<~PROSE
    In the volcanic highlands where the #{encyclopedia_ref :khar, "khar"} herds shelter through the hot hours, herders count twice. The first count is stock. The second is for the mimic: the animal that stands plate for plate among the herd, low and patient in the shade cluster, matching the true beasts' shuffles a half-beat late — and running, to any instrument pointed at it, warmer than a living khar with the mass reading of loose ash. Khar mimics have stood among Ashvane's herds since the early Rekindling by the survey record and since the Silent Bloom by the herders' own accounting, and the relationship the hot country has settled on is the one its cultures teach with the flat firmness of a boundary line: count it, note it, leave it be.

    Annual herd-loss audits attribute suspected mimic losses to heat, strikes, or a mistaken count. Training accounts instead preserve close approaches: a herder who reached toward an uncounted animal and met its eyes at arm's length, and a dog that entered the cluster and returned walking backward. Two survey programs publish the same thermal signature, late half-beat, and loose-ash mass reading. One pays herders for count logs and leaves the herds alone. The other has offered a carcass bounty since 2398 and sends dusk teams to follow the extra animal out of the cluster; highland families turn those teams off their grazing, and a few young herders take the program's money anyway and walk out after dark with a lamp. The ash swept from a shade cluster's ground after the herd moves sells in highland markets as mimic leavings, to buyers who want it for luck or for the program's assay tables. Herders retain the observed rule in one elder's recorded words: the mimic stands where the shade is, the shade stands where the herd is, and the herd is left whole.
  PROSE

  cue "The shade cluster tallies one heavy on the second count, and the herder marks the slate, moves the water trough a little wider, and works the far side of the herd all afternoon."
  cue "Forty paces off it is a khar among khars; at four, the plates run too regular, the fringe stirs against the wind, and the eyes come up to meet the look."
  affordance "A marked mimic remains with the shade cluster while the herd runs normally, and survey programs pay herders for count and movement logs that fixed instruments cannot gather."
  pressure "A buyer who wants the whole shade cluster driven to the sale pens by noon pushes the herder to split the herd around an animal that must be left standing, and the hired hands paid by the head are the ones tempted to cut straight through. A carcass bounty worth a season's wool keeps drawing young herders out after the mimic at dusk, against their families."
  variation "Ashvane's mimics stand with highland herds and are logged by generations of the same families; Crucible's ore-field crews keep a separate file on plateless silhouettes standing in machine shade."
  variation "Herding apprentices learn the sideways glance, double count, and leave-whole rule before their first season, then make both counts under a senior's eye."
