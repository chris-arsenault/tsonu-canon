  prose <<~PROSE
    Shearwurms are segmented Farborn borers that live inside soft debris masses and coarse ringglass aggregates. Most working specimens are narrower than a ship corridor and long enough to cross one several times. Their plated bodies follow tunnels cut by rings of small mouths, each ring able to turn independently around the animal's axis.

    A shearwurm can make a useless rubble mass into a set of strong, smooth-walled passages. It can also hollow the one load-bearing seam holding a work site together. Salvagers inspect the tunnels, shed plates, and fresh bore dust before trusting any fragment known to hold one.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :biology, heading: "Mouth Rings and Eyes"
    Each segment carries a belt of dark eyes along its underside. The belts vanish inside the tunnel while the animal moves and appear one after another when it crosses an opening. Individual eyes track light and nearby motion. The whole arrangement also follows low structural vibration through the surrounding mass.

    The forward mouth rings do the cutting. Hard plates close on mineral grains, twist, and pass the loosened material backward through separate feeding openings. Some stock is digested. Ringglass and metal collect in chambers along the body, where repeated pressure and resonance sort them into dense layers. Old shearwurms carry enough glass to answer a sounder from across a fragment.

    Shearwurms add segments while feeding and shed the worn inner plates of their mouth rings. A shed plate is translucent at the edge and dark near its root. Fresh plates still carry the animal's cutting response after separation, which makes them valuable to toolmakers.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Reading a Burrow"
    A live tunnel has fine dust moving along one wall even in still air. Regular crescent marks show where mouth plates bit and turned. The tunnel often branches around a strong structural seam, leaving a rib of untouched material between openings. Those ribs can support a surprising load until the animal returns to feed on the glass accumulated within them.

    Survey crews place mechanical pins across a burrow rather than sounding directly into it. A changed pin angle shows movement without giving the shearwurm a strong tone to follow. Active sounders are used from a distance and shut down after a single pulse. Repeated structural notes can bring the animal back along its own tunnel.

    Small specimens retreat from pressure and bright heat. Large ones may continue boring through a bulkhead, receiver wall, or anchored cutter because the active structure provides a cleaner path than rubble. A shearwurm crossing a pressurized room rarely attacks its occupants. The breach it leaves can kill them.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :trade, heading: "What Crews Take"
    Shed mouth plates are the safest harvest. Crews find them in old feeding pockets, wash away adhering tissue, and store each plate between dead ceramic pads. Tool shops grade them by the tone at the root and by whether the edge still changes angle under pressure.

    Shearwurm-worked tunnel sections are valuable in their own right. The animal compacts mixed glass and mineral along some walls into curved panels with continuous grain. A crew can cut those panels free for instrument housings and pressure shells. The same fragment may contain hidden chambers of brittle waste, so buyers demand a complete burrow survey.

    Live capture pays more and succeeds rarely. A contained shearwurm needs a changing stock of rubble, isolated structural mass, and room to extend. Research pens that hold the animal against a fixed wall eventually become part of its tunnel.

  cue "Rows of steel pins stand across the mouth of a smooth round passage in a debris mass, each with a strip of bright cloth on its head, and a surveyor crouches beside them with a slate, sketching the angle of every pin."
  cue "In a toolmaker's stall, flat crescent plates lie in a padded tray, clear as ice at the edge and dark at the root, and when the owner presses one against a whetstone its edge visibly turns."
  affordance "Sustained sounding, a repeated hammer, or a scan run twice near a shearwurm-held fragment is a structural note the animal follows. It comes back along a tunnel it already cut, so it arrives through ground the crew has walked and cleared."
  pressure "A burrow leaves ribs of untouched material between its openings, and those ribs hold load until the animal returns to feed on the glass inside them. Shoring, a braced floor, or a survey done last week can stop being true with nothing visible changing."
  variation "Young shearwurms a few segments long work loose aggregate near a fragment's surface, back away from pressure and bright heat, and leave narrow twisting tunnels a crew can empty of them with a bright lamp held at the mouth."
  variation "Old shearwurms, grown too long to turn in their own tunnels and heavy with sorted glass, keep to the deep seams of one fragment for years; a sounder pulse from across the mass comes back from their bodies as a second, brighter structure."
