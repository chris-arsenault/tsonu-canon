  prose <<~PROSE
    Sarn are large migratory animals that cross the gaps between ring fragments. A mature animal has a narrow body, four steering fins, and two fans of flexible mineral combs grown from its sides. The largest reach the length of a small transport.

    The combs grip kinetic gradients. A sarn twists them to climb a drive wake, turn through a habitat field, or exchange momentum with nearby members of the herd. Their spirals distribute strain across hundreds of bodies, allowing young and injured animals to travel near the quiet center.

    A vessel entering the spiral becomes another load in that exchange. Adults may turn its momentum toward the outer edge faster than its kite can cancel it. Perch closes approach lanes when a herd tightens and sends low collection craft beneath the field rather than through it.

    Old combs loosen during the seasonal passage at #{ref :perch, "Perch"}. Their mineral fibers retain the loads carried during growth and have become valuable materials. Collection crews wait for a comb to separate and keep their lines outside the living fans; a cut made early can pull an entire collection frame into the herd's shared turn.
  PROSE

  cue "Sarn cross gaps on their own schedule, so a herd may enter a lane the charts show as clear; the first warning to an approaching vessel is often the hab closing its lanes ahead."
  cue "A mature animal has a narrow body, four steering fins, and two fans of flexible mineral combs grown from its sides."
  affordance "A vessel beneath a migrating spiral can observe or collect without entering the load exchange. Inside the spiral, the herd passes its momentum toward the outer edge and escape follows the turn."
  pressure "Collection crews wait for a comb to separate and keep their lines outside the living fans; an early cut remains attached to the animal and draws the frame into the herd's shared turn."
  variation "Their spirals distribute strain across hundreds of bodies, allowing young and injured animals to travel near the quiet center."
  variation "Old combs loosen during the seasonal passage at #{ref :perch, "Perch"}."
