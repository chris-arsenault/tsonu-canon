  cue "A worked piece answers strain with a low audible hum, so a frame taking a load it was not built for says so aloud."
  affordance "Growers shape each stem while it lives so the harvested wood keeps its imposed curve through drying."

  prose <<~PROSE
    At #{ref :noll, "Noll"}, coppiced navren trees grow copper-green bark over pale wood whose fibers align with sustained pressure and a low structural tone. Cultivar plates beside the oldest surviving root stools supply the name.

    Growers shape each stem while it lives. Weights set the broad curve, grafts redirect individual fibers, and water-borne resonance settles the grain around the intended load. A harvested piece keeps that shape through drying and answers strain with a low audible hum.

    Shipwrights use navren for braces that must flex across different hull materials; builders set it around doors and pressure transitions. Instrument makers take narrow offcuts whose growth marks show the tones they carry best. Once dry, the grain holds its imposed curve and ceases to answer a new growth field.
