  summary "Clocks are building-sized engineered creatures that coil around habitat air shafts and breathe for the structure, exhaling whenever the frame bends. The elves grew them as living ventilation, and the habs that still have one build their lives around its breath."

  prose <<~PROSE
    A handful of habs still breathe through a clock. The creature fills its shaft gallery like rope coiled in a locker — a pale, building-sized bulk crowned with bell-shaped lung chambers — and it does for its section what pumps do elsewhere: drives the air, holds the pressure, and answers the structure's flexing with compensating breath. The #{encyclopedia_ref :elves, "elves"} grew them for the intact ring as living ventilation, and the ring's registers list them among machinery, by shaft and feeding schedule, with the same bureaucratic calm they give the pumps.

    The habs call them clocks because a district lives to the breath: it quickens with crowded halls, eases in the off-shift, and rings faintly at the crown on each exhale. When the frame bends, from a docking shock or a settling span, the creature exhales hard, and the gust reaches the galleries ahead of the creak. Vey's ward wardens treat the lung's rhythm as an instrument in its own right and log it beside the gauge readings, because the coil reads loads through the structure minutes before the hab's own instruments agree.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Keeping a Lung"
    A clock is fed at the shaft mouth — condensate sludge and gallery sweepings by the barrow, on a schedule its #{encyclopedia_ref :minder, "minder"} keeps and its district subsidizes — and worked around with tide-table discipline. Shaft maintenance happens in the long ease of the off-shift breath; a crew caught inside on a hard exhale comes out bruised and lectured. The creature tolerates its neighbors with the indifference of weather, and the one recorded exception is engine noise new to it, which turns the crown slowly and quickens the rhythm until the noise becomes familiar or leaves.

    Every documented clock predates the Glassfall. The archives preserve intact-ring clutch entries, shaft assignments, and a hatching notation the trades have not reproduced. Each surviving lung has a named minder, a civic feeding budget, and a standing rule that its health governs schedules touching the shaft.
  PROSE

  cue "The whole gallery breathes — a long, faintly ringing exhale moves the hung laundry and everyone's hair at once — and conversation pauses around it as automatically as around a passing cart."
  cue "A barrow crew tips condensate sludge into the shaft-mouth trough while a coil the color of old ceramic shifts somewhere above, and the barrow crew's timing is visibly rehearsed."
  affordance "The lung is a living pressure system and early-warning instrument in one: it answers structural loads minutes ahead of the gauges, and a ward that logs its rhythm alongside instrument readings catches what either alone would miss."
  pressure "Maintenance crews schedule entry during the long ease of the off-shift breath and clear the gallery when the crown turns toward an unfamiliar engine note. The minder calls the work from the animal's current rhythm."
  variation "Vey's clock is civic property with a salaried minder and a feeding budget defended in ward sessions; a smaller lung in the outer arcs is kept by three families who split the barrow rota and the standing."
  variation "Districts differ on the courtesies — some hush engine tests near the shaft by ordinance, others introduce new machinery to the creature deliberately, running it soft nearby until the crown settles."
