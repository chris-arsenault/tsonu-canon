  prose <<~PROSE
    Marn are broad-footed grazing animals kept across #{ref :avar, "Avar"} for wool, milk, hides, and meat. A mature animal stands chest-high on a human and carries a deep body under a coat that grows dense along the spine and sparse around the legs. Herding families move them between ridge shelter and open grass as water and road conditions change.

    The animals are patient on firm stone and reluctant on glass-bearing clay. They feel low vibration through the outer pads of each foot and often refuse ground beginning to slip beneath a repeated load. Herders watch that response. Route keepers treat it as a reason to send a sounding crew and change a road's status only on the crew's report.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :biology, heading: "Feet, Coat, and Senses"
    Each foot divides into two hard inner toes surrounded by a broad flexible pad. On dry ground the toes carry most of the weight. In wet clay the pad spreads and releases at an angle, leaving a shallow crescent print instead of a deep hole. Hair between the pads stiffens when the ground vibrates and gives the animal a low, continuous sense of nearby movement.

    Marn hear ordinary sound well and react more strongly to vibration arriving through their feet. A herd can notice a loaded caravan beyond a ridge before its bells carry through the wind. The same sensitivity makes them difficult near mills, pumps, and badly balanced kinetic drives. Animals raised beside one machine learn its rhythm; a changed bearing can unsettle the entire pen.

    Their coat contains a coarse weather layer over soft insulating wool. Steppe spinners separate the two at washing. The long fibers become rope, packing, and hard-wearing cloth. The inner wool goes into clothing, blankets, and the felt pads placed between cargo and a sounding frame.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Herd Work"
    A family herd ranges from a few animals kept beside a farm to several hundred moving between seasonal camps. Lead animals know wells, salt grounds, and the sheltered cuts through a stone shelf. Herders change the route after flood, road work, or a new survey closure and allow time for the herd to learn it. Driving unfamiliar animals across a marked red section is both dangerous and an effective way to lose the trust of every neighboring camp.

    Marn feed on steppe grass, tough scrub, and the leaves left after grain harvest. They need dependable water and cannot take enough from green forage during the dry season. Public well orders therefore name livestock basins explicitly. In a shortage, drinking taps remain first while herd allotments shift to outlying shafts and temporary trough lines.

    Milking and shearing take place in low pens on stone or well-drained soil. A singing route stake outside the gate lets handlers compare the pen with the approach. If the tones divide, the herd leaves before the fence and water trough add another repeated load to the moving layer.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "On a Moving Road"
    Pack marn carry light loads across highland paths too narrow for a hauler. Their pace is slow, and the broad pads handle broken ground without damaging the trails as quickly as wheels or skids. Market caravans often combine pack animals with haulers, shifting grain, wool, instruments, and replacement parts between them when a road changes class.

    The animals dislike active kite fields. A flitter settling nearby sends a kinetic correction through the ground that can make a tethered group pull at once. Ladderwell keeps the livestock yards below the benches and the kite field beyond them. Smaller markets post a landing interval during which animals are held away from the pad.

    A marn that plants all four feet and lowers its head may have sensed moving ground, an approaching vehicle, or another animal calling through the soil. Herders check the whole herd before deciding. One refusal is temperament. Twenty facing the same empty hollow is a reason to move the caravan.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "Marks and Exchange"
    Ownership marks are cut into horn sheaths that grow behind the jaw and shed as the animal matures. The mark identifies a household and season rather than permanently branding the body. Lost animals can be returned from the most recent sheath; old pieces become buttons, tool scales, and counters used in market accounts.

    Breeding animals move widely through loan and exchange. A household that accepts a male for one season returns wool, young stock, or future water access according to the local agreement. Those obligations travel between wells and can outlast the animals that created them.

    Market towns process more marn goods than they raise. #{ref :ladderwell, "Ladderwell"} is the eastern steppe's largest wool and machinery exchange, where highland carriers meet lowland herds and repair shops produce pumps sturdy enough for both routes.
  PROSE

  cue "A steppe market's landing pad has a painted board beside it giving the hours flitters may come down, and when a craft settles early every tethered marn in the yard below jerks its head up at once and leans back against its rope."
  cue "After rain the road into a herding camp is stamped with thousands of shallow crescents, and children sit by the pen gate sorting a basket of shed horn sheaths by the notches cut into them."
  affordance "Herders read one refusal as temperament and a whole herd facing the same empty ground as reason to move the caravan. Route keepers record the behavior and inspect the section before changing its status."
  pressure "Animals kept beside a settlement learn the rhythm of the machine they live next to, and a changed bearing unsettles the entire pen. Work on a mill or pump reaches the livestock before anyone else notices, and the handlers arrive wanting to know what was altered."
  variation "Farm marn kept in threes and fours beside a homestead are milked daily, grow heavy soft wool, and learn the one pump they live beside; camp herds of several hundred are leaner, rougher-coated, and follow lead animals who know every well on the seasonal round."
  variation "Highland pack marn are bred for short legs and wide pads, carry a light load in felt-padded panniers along paths no hauler can use, and keep their coarse weather coat long at shearing so it pads the load."
