  summary "Irides are blue-loam pollinators whose glassy body scales hold the color of the last healthy flower they worked. Kept lofts forage by day and return at dusk, when gardeners compare the landing board's colors with the beds in range."

  origin "Native to the blue-loam country and spread with the beds; the terraces keep loft lines bred for range and steadiness of color"
  biology "A thumb-joint pollinator armored in fine glassy scales that ring to the resonance of a healthy bloom and hold its color for a day; sick or stressed flowers set the scales dull gray"
  function "Pollinates the blue-loam crops and reports on them — a loft's evening colors map which beds the day's foraging found healthy and which it found failing"
  lifespan "Working foragers live a season; a loft queen lives #{duration 5} and carries the loft's homing to its ground"
  resonance_relation "The color-taking is a resonance mechanism: a bloom in health rings in its species' band, the scales take the ring as color, and a flower too sick to ring leaves the iride gray"

  prose <<~PROSE
    Irides are thumb-joint pollinators armored in fine glassy scales. They leave their lofts after the beds warm, follow bloom resonance across the blue loam, and return along stable foraging paths before dusk. A healthy flower sets the scales to its color: reedwhite, loam blue, graft-flare orange. The color persists until another healthy bloom changes it, then fades toward gray over a day. They pollinate while feeding, favoring strongly ringing flowers and revisiting productive stands.

    A loft centers on a long-lived queen and one season's foragers. Keepers breed lines for range, homing, and color stability, exchange queens between terraces, and place lofts where several beds overlap. At dusk the returning irides crowd the landing board by route. Keepers log the color bands and compare them with the known flower palette. A gray return means that the last strong color has faded without replacement; it directs a morning search but does not identify the cause or exact bed.

    Dyeworks and flare pits can cast unrelated color into the scales, so cooperatives site lofts away from them and treat unusual mixed colors cautiously. A disturbed loft swarms its entrance, while foragers in the beds usually divide around a slow worker. Gardeners therefore handle the animals as pollinators first and read the color as one feature of a colony's ordinary foraging life.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Lofts Away From the Blue Loam"
    Gardeners at #{ref :naloven} keep imported irides beside planted blue-loam beds within the orchards. The lofts follow those familiar crops; neighboring #{encyclopedia_ref :ulessa} trees chiefly receive their own #{encyclopedia_ref :taluri}. At #{ref :seren}, #{ref :nara_pell} compares returns from trial beds before recommending a loft for an unfamiliar planting.

    Small lofts have also reached heated cultivation rooms in #{ref :ithara}. There, living #{encyclopedia_ref :nethri} fans can spread beside ordinary imported flowers without giving the irides a recognizable floral signal. A grey insect beside a healthy fan establishes that mismatch, not a diagnosis of the fan. The insects remain inside the rooms; Lithren's open surface offers neither their air nor their feeding ground.

  cue "The dusk stream comes home to the landing boards in bands of color — reedwhite, loam blue, flare-orange — and one thin streak of gray that has the keeper reaching for the loft book and the morning's boots."
  cue "The visiting buyer admires an iride colored perfect graft-orange, and the keeper, eyes still on the boards, names which row it worked, and that the row two over rang quiet all week."
  affordance "A kept loft pollinates several beds and gives gardeners a same-day sample of which healthy flowers its foragers reached."
  variation "Terrace cooperatives run large lofts with logged evening readings; household gardens keep smaller lofts and compare the landing board with their beds at supper."
  variation "Loft lines differ in range and palette-steadiness, and the breeding meets where keepers trade queens are the blue-loam country's quiet genetics exchange."
