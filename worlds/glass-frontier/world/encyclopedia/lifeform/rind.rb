    appearance: "Roughly the size of a small courier kite, most of the body enclosed in an opaque pale-grey carapace whose irregular crystal inclusions catch bands of light for Tuners and look dull to everyone else. Dozens of hair-fine filaments trail ten to fifteen meters behind the shell.",
    behavior: "A rind advances along a sustained resonance gradient at walking speed or slower, holds position while the source stays steady, and circles outward hunting the line when the source weakens. Deep-runners redirect one with a counter-tone placed beyond the route they want it to take.",
    threat: "A filament brushing active ringglass sets up a sympathetic response through both materials. The animal is unharmed, the array mount can remain out of calibration for hours, and striking the shell scatters the filaments into more contacts."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Rinds are large animals of the #{ref :deep_shear, "Deep Shear"} that follow sustained resonance gradients. Deep-runners named them for the pale shell enclosing most of the body.

    They move slowly past ships and people, holding course toward a stable signal. Their trailing filaments make that scale dangerous: a rind seeks the same signals that hold tuned structures in calibration, and contact can disrupt active ringglass.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :description, heading: "Body"
    A rind is roughly the size of a small courier kite. An opaque pale-grey carapace encloses most of the body. Irregular crystal inclusions catch bands of light visible to #{encyclopedia_ref :resonant_tuner, "Tuners"} and appear dull to everyone else.

    Dozens of hair-fine filaments trail ten to fifteen meters behind the shell. They drift independently, producing a harmonic at the edge of hearing. A filament touching active ringglass sets up a sympathetic response through both materials. The animal survives the contact while the array mount can remain out of calibration for hours.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Gradient Following"
    A rind advances along a resonance gradient at walking speed or slower. It can hold position for days when the source remains steady. If the source weakens, it circles outward until it finds the line again.

    Deep-runners redirect them with a counter-tone placed beyond the desired route. The work takes patience and a clear field. Striking the shell scatters the filaments and creates more contacts, so experienced crews keep weapons cold unless the animal is already inside a structure.
  PROSE

  cue "The Tuner calls the approach first — a band of light in the shell's inclusions that reads dull to everyone else — and the crew starts the counter-tone drill while the animal is still ten minutes of walking-speed away."
  cue "A trailing filament brushes the array mount in passing, both materials take up the sympathetic response, and the rig's calibration is gone for the afternoon while the rind drifts on, entirely well."
  affordance "A rind's course is a free gradient survey — the animal walks the strongest sustained resonance line in reach — and deep crews chart where the local rinds hold station the way river pilots chart deep water."
  variation "Shear-edge rinds are small, singly encountered, and redirected as routine; the Deep Shear's hold whole slow congregations at the great standing gradients, and crews route around those grounds entirely."
  variation "Course records support both feeding and navigation models for gradient-following. No observed mouth, intake cycle, nest, or return route yet distinguishes between them."
