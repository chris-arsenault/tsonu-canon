  prose <<~PROSE
    A stillweight is a portable structural clamp used to hold a door, brace, vehicle, or broken piece of a building in its present relation to nearby mass. The machine has a squat metal body, three jointed feet, and a ringglass core behind a thick hand wheel. Workers call it a deadweight when it is being used and a stillweight when it is being inspected, sold, or blamed.

    The object keeps exactly its own strength. The clamp gives an applied load somewhere else to return, routing the pull through its feet into the chosen mass. A sound placement can hold a shifting wall while people leave. A poor one can keep the clamp still while the wall tears around its feet.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "Taking a Seat"
    All three feet must contact the object or structure being held. The operator opens the wheel until the core answers the lowest clear structural tone available nearby, then closes it gradually while watching witness pins at each foot. The pins show how much load is returning through that contact.

    Once seated, the clamp resists movement relative to the chosen mass. On a road, that may be deep stone beneath a sliding surface layer. On a ship, it may be the main hull rather than the drifting cargo frame. In a Bloom cordon, the nearest stable mass can change while the clamp remains active, which is why Council crews mark both ends of the relation before applying force.

    The hand wheel is intentionally slow. A powered close can take a false tone and reach full load before the witness pins reveal the mistake. Two workers normally set the machine: one turns, one reads the contacts and the surrounding structure.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :applications, heading: "Field Uses"
    Rescue crews place stillweights across a damaged hatch before cutting away a bent hinge. Counterweight movers use them to hold a pressure sled while another support changes height. Claim crews clamp loose stock before a cutter pulls on the far side of the seam. Road teams anchor a hauler during ground movement or secure a bridge panel after its ordinary seat fails.

    A stillweight can restrain a moving machine if the operator reaches a sound part of it. It is unreliable against a person or animal: flesh yields around the feet, clothing tears, and the nearest clear tone usually belongs to the floor. Crews do use one to pin a Farborn shell, jaw plate, or rigid limb after the living tissue has been driven away from the contact.

    The machine releases in reverse order. The load must be transferred to an ordinary support before the wheel opens. A clamp removed while still carrying weight can jump, twist its feet, or return the held motion all at once.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :dangers, heading: "The Wrong Anchor"
    Stillweights follow structural continuity wherever it runs, whatever the operator meant to hold against. A clamp placed on a warehouse floor may take its seat from the buried water line, a neighboring crane foundation, or a resonant seam crossing the whole yard. The first pull then moves or stresses that unmonitored service or neighboring structure.

    Standard practice begins with a low test load and observers at every plausible return. Workers chalk the selected tone on the machine and repeat it on the structure. If the two marks disagree after a shift, the area clears before anyone touches the wheel.

    Counterfeit cores create another hazard. A poor ringglass cut can hold during setup and divide under a changing load, leaving each fragment anchored to a different mass. The casing then becomes the connection between motions the machine can no longer reconcile.
  PROSE

  cue "Secondhand buyers open the core before a stillweight sale closes. Blue-backed cores and ground-off lot plates end the inspection, and an owner who refuses it is assumed to be moving recalled stock."
  cue "Two workers crouch at a buckled hatch: one turns a heavy wheel a quarter-turn at a time while the other lies flat on the deck, eye level with a row of pins at the machine's feet, calling numbers."
  affordance "A seated stillweight holds a shifting wall, hatch, bridge panel or hauler still while people leave or cut, and it can pin a Farborn shell, jaw plate, or rigid limb once living tissue has been cleared from the contact."
  pressure "The clamp seats on whatever mass is structurally continuous: a buried water line, the next crane's foundation, or a seam crossing the whole yard. Crews begin with a low test load and station observers at every plausible return."
  variation "Rescue stillweights are light enough for one worker to lift onto a hatch and seat on short feet; road and bridge units ride a sled and spread their feet a full stride apart."
  variation "Cordon crews in Bloom country carry clamps with a second witness dial that shows which mass the core is seated on, since the nearest stable mass can change while the clamp is holding."
