  prose <<~PROSE
    Dovrans carry people and goods through Korvath's #{ref :dovra, "Dovra"}. Their hulls are broad, shallow, and plain below the waterline. A loaded vessel can cross water that reaches little above a pilot's knee, settle on mud without damage, and back away after a channel closes ahead. Most belong to a household, village, mill, or water board rather than a long-haul carrier.

    Dovrans change during their working lives. Deck houses lift away. Cargo rails move between sockets. A grain vessel becomes a passenger boat for a gate-closing market and a flood ferry when the outer note changes. The hull and route license usually outlast several engines, crews, and channel maps.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "Hull, Drive, and Pole"
    The hull uses local timber over ceramic ribs. The ceramic interrupts the broad native resonance carried by Korvath's wet iron sediment, keeping a gate, crane, or another vessel from pulling through the Dovran's metal fittings. Damaged ribs are replaced before cosmetic hull work because a Dovran that begins answering the river can turn sideways under an otherwise manageable load.

    A small stern drive handles deep or open water. In narrow channels the pilot uses poles, tow lines, or a bank crew. The sounding pole carries a metal shoe and marked grip. Its pressure tells the pilot how the bottom will hold; its returned tone distinguishes loose silt from buried iron sand and the ceramic apron near a gate.

    #{encyclopedia_ref :tolven, "Tolven"} make that reading less certain. The animals strike a sounding shoe from beneath the bank and can make firm ground feel suddenly alive. Experienced pilots pause after the first blow, look for the spreading rings, and use a second pole before changing course.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "A Route That Does Not Stay Put"
    A Dovran route is a sequence of depths, permissions, tow points, and gate intervals. The chart records its current line; pilots memorize the order in which its conditions appear. They learn the color of disturbed water, the angle of reed growth, the feel of bottom pressure, and which household controls the line fixed to a difficult bend.

    Water boards post closures at landing stairs and transmit them to neighboring gates. A local pilot still sounds the approach. Silt can rise after the notice left. A Dovran ahead can cut a new passage. Two registered gate tones can begin answering through saturated ground and release water into a channel the board believed quiet.

    At night, small lamps hang low over both sides of the hull so another pilot can read its loaded draft. Bright mast lights obscure the banks and are reserved for open water. Crews speak quietly near a gatehouse because the workers there may be listening for a pressure change beneath the chains.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "Household Vessels"
    A working Dovran often carries several generations without making all of them crew. The deck house contains bunks, a stove, record shelves, and a dry locker for route tallies. Children learn lines and landing work before they take a pole. Older pilots may stop handling cargo and retain authority over the route because they remember channels no current map shows.

    Village Dovrans rotate crews by season. Orchard districts run hardest at harvest. Kiln settlements move clay inward and ceramic outward all year. Water boards maintain flat-deck Dovrans loaded with gate timber, earth baskets, pumps, food, and flood shelters. During an emergency any suitable vessel can be called into board service, with its lost work recorded beside the labor supplied from shore.

    Payment mixes freight fees, reciprocal carriage, and shares of the load. A vessel may deliver fruit for coin, return with repair tile owed to its home gate, and carry three passengers whose families supplied food during the last flood.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Tallies and Hidden Channels"
    Every cargo entering #{ref :lowbank, "Lowbank"} passes a tally house. The sealed record names the pilot, declared load, boards crossed, and the interval used at each registered gate. It can prove that a shipment followed an inspected route without publishing the small channels that make the route possible.

    The protection also permits concealment. A forged tally can move contraband into a legitimate warehouse. An honest pilot can carry one sealed crate through four jurisdictions and know only that every board accepted it. Port inspectors open suspicious cargo; water boards object when the inspection delays a vessel in a channel needed for flood work.

    Pilots preserve their local routes because those routes are their livelihood and their towns' emergency access. They share depths and closures freely when life is at risk. Ownership, cargo, and the quiet way around a port gate receive a different answer.
  PROSE

  cue "A Dovran slides past a landing stair with washing strung between the deck house and the cargo rail, a grandmother shelling beans on the roof, and a boy at the bow pushing off the bank with his foot."
  cue "The pilot leans on the sounding pole, head tilted toward the water, and the whole family on deck goes still until she lifts it and nods."
  affordance "A Dovran carries a village's fruit, clay, passengers, and flood timber through channels too shallow and shifting for any deeper hull, and settles on the mud to wait out a closure."
  pressure "A water board can call any suitable vessel into flood service with its cargo aboard, so a household whose fruit rots on deck during a flood call wants the lost work paid, and a pilot hiding a forged-tally crate wants to be anywhere but a board channel full of inspectors."
  variation "Household Dovrans carry three generations and run a route the family has held for decades; board Dovrans are flat decks of gate timber and earth baskets, crewed by whoever the board has on shift."
  variation "Orchard districts load their Dovrans to the rails at harvest and leave them tied up half the year; kiln settlements keep theirs moving clay inward and ceramic outward every month."
