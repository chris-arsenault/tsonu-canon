  prose <<~PROSE
    Bulk kites move goods along #{ref :keel, "the Keel"} and the outer-system trade routes. They are the largest civilian #{encyclopedia_ref :kite, "kite"}-driven vessels in regular commercial service, recognizable by oversized arrays, modular cargo bays, and the brackets of a reinforced hull frame. #{ref :vantara, "Vantara"} operates the largest fleet; independent crews run the rest.

    Several yards build regional and operator patterns to the same working specifications. Loaded bulk kites fly slowly and steadily enough for long schedules to hold. Their arrays become twitchy against an empty hull, so operators plan useful tonnage in both directions.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "What They Carry"
    Most bulk kites, most of the time, are moving one of four cargoes.

    **Ringglass.** Bulk ringglass from the #{ref :the_shear, "Shear"}'s extraction operations and surface refineries, in grades ranging from industrial aggregate to specialist mid-grade. Ringglass is heavy, fragile under sympathetic resonance interference, and the system's single largest traded commodity by mass. A typical Keel-running bulk kite carries thirty to sixty percent ringglass on most outbound legs.

    **Water.** Outer-system ice, processed water from the moons, and smaller flows from surface aquifers form the system's second-largest bulk trade. Shielded tanks occupy roughly a third of a bulk kite's interior volume on water runs. The tankage requires specialist inspection and slows loading, so crews tend to remain in water service or avoid it.

    **Foodstuffs and bulk consumables.** Grain from surface agricultural settlements, processed protein from hab-side fabrication, dry goods, the broad range of consumables that the system's habs cannot produce internally at the volumes their populations require. The trade has its own logistics culture and its own grumbling about Vantara's terms.

    **Equipment and industrial goods.** Precision cavities by the lot, machined components, finished resonance instruments, and habitat fabrication outputs. These make up the smallest fraction of typical cargo by volume and the highest fraction by value. Equipment loads are routinely insured and escorted.

    A working bulk kite usually carries mixed cargo, broken into bays, with the bays bulkheaded against each other for both physical and resonance separation. A bulk kite running a single cargo type for a single buyer is a chartered run and is rare enough to attract notice.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Coupled Freight"
    Cargo from #{encyclopedia_ref :claim_coupling, "Claim Coupling"} receives a separate loading plan. Material recovered on different cutter clocks cannot share a resonance bus, a structural brace, or a water tank. The bays travel dark, with their monitoring instruments isolated from the vessel's main cadence.

    The rule followed #{ref :pell_four, "Pell Four"}, when four separated claims remained related through a shared processing clock. The #{ref :pell_freight_assembly, "Pell Freight Assembly"} wrote the first loading standard for its own member fleet. The #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} adopted it for every bulk kite taking a remote-cut cargo through a public lane.

    Crews dislike the lost capacity. Empty bulkheads and separate instrument runs consume space that would otherwise earn freight. Masters enforce the rule because a coupled load can turn an ordinary brace or coolant line into a path between bays.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "Construction"
    A bulk kite is built around its #{encyclopedia_ref :kite, "kite"} arrays and its cargo capacity, in that order. Everything else — crew quarters, sensors, hull configuration — is laid out around the two structural priorities.

    The kite arrays are sized for the loaded vessel and oversized for its empty mass. Empty holds therefore make the handling twitchy, while a full load settles the response. Operators plan meaningful tonnage in both directions and price deadhead legs as lost capacity.

    The hull is structural-band reinforced beyond what the kite arrays require because bulk kites cross pirated lanes, extraction traffic, and disturbed resonance fields where a loaded structural failure can open several cargo bays at once. The reinforcement is heavy and visible; the bracketed frame identifies the class on approach.

    The cargo holds are modular and rebuildable. A major port can reconfigure an interior over several days, allowing the same hull to carry ringglass one season and water the next. The cost keeps most vessels fitted for one primary cargo.

    A compact bridge leaves room for galleys, common rooms, individual cabins, and sometimes a library or training room. Crews live aboard for weeks and rotate through monitoring, maintenance, and rest while the kite arrays hold the routine course. Long-running crews commonly remain together for fifteen or twenty years.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :people, heading: "Crew"
    A bulk kite carries eight to twelve people under a master who combines operational command with commercial authority. Pilots rotate through two or three watches. A cargo officer oversees securing, manifests, and inter-port trade; independent crews commonly combine that work with another post. Two or three engineers and array-wrights maintain the hull and kite arrays, while deckhands cover watches, repairs, and work outside the hull.

    Keel runs require a Clarisant-credentialed #{encyclopedia_ref :resonant_tuner, "Tuner"} under Shear Compact rules. The Tuner monitors array health and manages structural reinforcement through disturbed fields. Runs with armed escorts also assign one officer to the formation's shared traffic and maneuvering channel.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Escort"
    Bulk kites use armed escort through the Keel's pirated stretches, remote outer-system lanes, and routes with known hostile traffic.

    Vantara operates the largest escort fleet — purpose-built armed kites that fly in formation with chartered bulk kites — and offers escort as a service to independents at standard rates. Independent escort operators exist and compete. The market is structured enough that a bulk-kite captain planning a run knows roughly what escort the run will require and roughly what it will cost.

    Bulk-kite and escort crews keep professionally separate circles. They eat at different mess halls in port, gather at different bars, and marry each other at lower rates than the wider working-spacer population. Fleet contracts reinforce the separation through distinct command chains and a single liaison on each vessel.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :description, heading: "Variants"
    The bulk-kite class has several named subtypes that crews and operators recognize:

    **The Keelhauler.** The most common subtype. Long-hull configuration optimized for Keel runs between the central markets and ringglass production zones. Standard cargo capacity, reinforced hull, escort-friendly silhouette. Most independent operators run Keelhaulers.

    **The Outer-Run.** Larger, heavier, longer-leg variant for runs to and from the outer-system moons. Heavier resonance arrays, larger fuel reserves, more comfortable crew quarters. Vantara operates most of these; the route economics support large vessels and the larger vessels support better margins.

    **The Tank-Bulk.** Water-specialist configuration. The hull is built around large shielded water tanks, and the conversion to other cargoes is expensive enough that most Tank-Bulks stay in water service for their entire working lives. A specialist's vessel, run by specialist crews.

    **The Ring-Tender.** A smaller subtype for repeated short runs between adjacent ring habs, with limited deep-space capacity.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Fleet and Family Life"
    Vantara adds hulls cautiously while independent operators retain a share of the routes. Keel traffic sustains steady demand for escorts along the pirated stretches.

    Bulk-kite wages support long careers and family quarters. Children are born aboard, study during port stops, take watches when they qualify, and often remain in the trade. The working population is older and changes crews less often than other spacer trades; a vessel remains small enough for everyone aboard to know one another through runs lasting weeks.
  PROSE

  cue "Getting anywhere along #{ref :keel, "the Keel"} usually means riding a bulk kite whose eight to twelve crew have sailed together for fifteen or twenty years, raise children aboard, and fold passengers into a watch rotation settled long before they booked passage."
  affordance "Chartering a bulk kite outright produces a vessel running one cargo for one buyer, and that manifest is rare enough that port clerks, rival masters, and escort operators all read something into it."
  pressure "Coupled freight requires separate clocks, instrument runs, braces, and tankage for each recovery. The isolation preserves the claims and consumes cargo space that would otherwise earn freight."
  cue "The bracketed silhouette resolves on approach with its escort kites in formation, and the port's traffic office starts the berth clock — a loaded bulk kite's schedule almost always holds."
  variation "Keelhaulers run the standard trade; Outer-Runs work the long legs to the moons under mostly Vantara colors; Tank-Bulks live their whole hulls in water service; Ring-Tenders shuttle the short hops between adjacent habs."
  variation "Vantara fleet crews run to fleet doctrine with escort liaisons aboard; independent masters combine posts, trade bay space port to port, and keep the family quarters that make a hull a household."
