  prose <<~PROSE
    An Eighth Seal is a palm-sized ceramic docket fixed to an object in Clearance Eight's custody. Eight radial channels accept impressions from the settlement's public desks. When every channel is filled, the center changes from gray to the color assigned to release, return, sale, quarantine, or continued custody.

    Each desk presses its finding through a tuned stylus. A reader moving clockwise around the seal receives the object's recovery circumstances, hazards, identity marks, route evidence, claim, debts, salvage value, and final disposition. The sequence binds later decisions to the evidence available at each step.

  PROSE

  cue "Anything handed into #{ref :clearance_eight}'s custody comes back wearing one. Read clockwise, it gives the hazards, identity marks, and route evidence behind the disposition rather than only the color at the center."
  cue "Eight radial channels accept impressions from the settlement's public desks."
  affordance "Push for an early release and the center is still gray: the color arrives only once all eight channels are impressed, so the empty channel names the desk that is refusing to sign."
  pressure "#{ref :tangent} carries authenticated blanks for retrievals beyond the custody docks, so a seal can be pressed far from the desks whose findings it records."
  variation "When every channel is filled, the center changes from gray to the color assigned to release, return, sale, quarantine, or continued custody."
  variation "Before every channel is filled, the center remains gray and the empty channel identifies the desk that has not signed."
