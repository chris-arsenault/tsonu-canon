  prose <<~PROSE
    Ashvane drays carry bulk freight between towns with too little traffic for regular flights or without dependable landing fields. They are long, low surface vehicles with broad wheel sets, reflective cargo covers, and radiator frames that rise above the body when stopped. A loaded dray moves slowly enough for its crew to inspect the road ahead and steadily enough to cross the moon's open plains before the next strong tidal heating period.

    Most use mechanical drives assisted by a small kinetic array. The wheels carry the vehicle. The array reduces the worst opposing load at soft salt, broken basalt, and steep crater approaches. Keeping the two systems separate allows a crew to continue after a ringglass fault and prevents the dray from depending on the same field conditions that may have closed a kite route.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "Built for Stored Heat"
    The cargo deck stands above a ventilated underframe. Ceramic breaks interrupt every metal path from the wheels to the load, slowing heat that enters through the road. Water, medicine, instruments, and other sensitive freight ride in the center bays behind packed mineral insulation. Stone, salt, kiln goods, and machinery occupy the hotter outer racks.

    The drive units sit at opposite ends. Either can move an empty vehicle and bring a loaded one to a safe stop. The kinetic array lies between them in a removable ceramic cradle, with short bus runs that a roadside crew can isolate without unloading the deck. Ashvane workshops favor parts that can be lifted by three people because repair shade is common and lifting machinery is not.

    Radiator frames fold flat while moving. At a rest bay the crew raises them, connects the cargo loops that need cooling, and sends accumulated heat into the night sky. A dray cannot shed heat quickly during the day without making a bright target for every temperature sensor along the road. Legal carriers publish their stops. Carriers concealing cargo avoid them and accept a hotter load.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "The Heat Roads"
    Maintained routes follow cooled flows, ridge shadows, and old fracture lines stable enough to survey. Marker posts carry a road number, the last inspection date, and a simple heat strip visible from the cab. At difficult crossings a buried ringglass cut answers a reference pulse from the dray. A slow, even return marks solid basalt. A divided answer can indicate a hot cavity or a fracture opening below the crust.

    Crews travel near evening when practical. The lead driver watches the surface and the array response. A second crew member manages cargo temperatures, water, and the next radiator stop. Long combinations add a rear cab so one operator can see a wheel set or trailer that has begun to settle before the pull reaches the front.

    Road houses maintain shade, water, repair pits, and public field readings. Some belong to towns, some to families, and some to freight associations that settle maintenance through reciprocal work. A carrier that uses a road house without replacing its water or reporting a damaged marker finds the next gate closed.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :trade, heading: "Loads in Both Directions"
    Outbound drays bring salt, glazed ceramic, basalt shapes, heat-rated pumps, preserved food, and replacement radiator sections to #{ref :shadewell, "Shadewell"}. They return with medicine, precision parts, ringglass cuts, sealed instruments, and whatever passengers prefer a surface route to another flight.

    A dray rarely carries one owner's goods. Freight houses assemble loads by temperature and handling need, then seal each bay separately. The crew may know the owner of every crate and remain unaware of the buyer. At small towns the vehicle also carries mail, legal notices, apprentices changing workshops, and patients whose condition permits a slow journey.

    Mobile lowland camps use the same chassis beneath their houses and workshops. When fractures shift, a camp strips its radiator masts, lifts the modular rooms onto dray beds, and moves to a surveyed pad. Those drays spend most seasons as stationary foundations and keep their drives covered against ash until the day the ground changes.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :limits, heading: "When a Road Closes"
    Heat defeats the vehicle gradually. Wheel grease thins, ceramic joints open, cooling water warms, and the kinetic cradle begins answering the ground instead of the drive. Crews stop at the first combination of faults rather than waiting for a single decisive alarm. A stranded dray provides shade and water for longer than it provides motion.

    Strong tidal periods close some low roads by schedule. Others close after a scout finds new steam, a changing marker tone, or salt crust too thin to carry a loaded wheel. The cargo then waits, transfers to smaller vehicles, or pays for a kite. Basalt temperature sets the delay.
  PROSE

  cue "Freight houses seal each bay by temperature and handling need, so the crew can name every owner on the manifest and none of the buyers. At small towns the same vehicle brings mail, legal notices, apprentices changing workshops, and patients well enough for a slow journey."
  cue "They are long, low surface vehicles with broad wheel sets, reflective cargo covers, and radiator frames that rise above the body when stopped."
  affordance "Asking a crew to shed heat before dark means raising the radiator frames in daylight, visible to every temperature sensor along the road, and their cooling stop will not match the one they published. Carriers running concealed cargo already accept the hotter load rather than do it."
  pressure "At bad crossings the dray pulses a buried ringglass cut and reads what returns: slow and even is solid basalt, a divided answer means a hot cavity or a fracture opening below. Crews turn back on that reading, and a stranded dray gives shade and water long after it gives motion."
  variation "Long combinations add a rear cab so one operator can see a wheel set or trailer that has begun to settle before the pull reaches the front."
  variation "Mobile lowland camps use the same chassis beneath their houses and workshops."
