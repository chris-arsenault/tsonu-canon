  prose <<~PROSE
    The hot roads of Ashvane and Crucible cross cinder fields — crusted, heat-glazed, patient ground that eats wheels, cooks axles, and shrugs at walkers — and the mane is the freight answer the hot settlements built when the Glassfall left them hauling their own ore. It is a broad low runner sled skinned in ceramic heat-tile, riding polished skids that sing on the crust, with its drive's exhaust rising through the row of spine stacks that gave the vehicle its name. The design's whole logic is the heat ledger: drive effort makes heat, the ground donates more, the stacks shed what they can, and everything about a run — load, pace, route, and rest — is the driver keeping that ledger in the black.

    The ledger is read at a glance from outside, which shapes the culture of the roads. A mane running cool trails thin pale smoke; one running toward its limit manes dark and low, and every crew that sights it knows the driver's afternoon. Mane convoys plan their days between #{encyclopedia_ref :passings, "passings"} like coastal traffic between tides — heavy legs run in the shade windows, the long midday passing is the trunk roads' rush hour, and a convoy caught fat and dark-maned in full light makes for the marked cool-stands, the crust hollows every route maintains, with the whole road's sympathy and full attention.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Crust Craft and Convoys"
    Crust is the road and the risk in one surface. Sound crust carries an ore convoy; thin crust carries the lead mane and opens under the third, and the difference is a note — mane crews sound doubtful ground ahead with weighted strikes and read the ring, the hot roads' cousin of the spider crews' sounding feet. Route books grade crust by season, cool-stands and thin runs are charted like soundings, and the roads' oldest working alliance is mane crews trading crust notes with the #{encyclopedia_ref :khar, "khar"} herders whose animals read the same ground for free.

    The patterns split by trade. Ashvane road manes run high racks and shielded cabs on the town legs; Crucible's ore convoys link low manes behind one drive unit and crew like small ships; and the cordon services keep light survey manes built for speed. Crews are two to a cab — driver on the ledger, mate on the crust — and the driver's traditional last act at shift's end is chalking the day's peak ledger figure on the mane's lead stack, where the next shift reads it before anything else.
  PROSE

  cue "The ore convoy comes down the shade leg singing on its skids, trailing thin pale smoke, and the watching crews read its mane the way sailors read a flag."
  cue "Ahead of the stopped convoy, the mate walks the crust swinging a weighted striker, and the whole crew turns at one dull ring."
  affordance "Linked manes move bulk freight across ground that ends every other carrier, and their smoke publishes each convoy's heat ledger to the whole road so crews can stage help before it is requested."
  pressure "Heat and crust share the route's arithmetic: the shade windows are everyone's rush hour, the cool-stands are finite, and a dark-maned convoy on thin crust is spending two budgets at once."
  variation "Ashvane road manes run high racks between towns on the passing schedule; Crucible's linked ore convoys crew like ships and rank their drivers by career ledger figures."
  variation "Crews chalk the shift's peak heat figure on the lead stack for the next crew, and the roads compare their lowest season ledgers at the last cool-stand gathering of the year."
