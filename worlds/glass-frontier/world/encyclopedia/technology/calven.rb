  prose <<~PROSE
    In the deep vaults of Verathi, Thornvault, and the Folded Annex, the archive still walks. The surviving register word for its carrier is *calven*: a chest-high, six-legged case-bearer of elven make, ceramic-shelled and patient, built to move sealed records between vault stations under a custody discipline stricter than most living couriers keep. Present a case and a seal-ring at the bed; the calven accepts the load, lights the manifest plate, and walks its route at the unhurried pace archives call document speed. At the far station it surrenders the case to the seal that matches its plate, and to that seal only.

    The machines have served the same halls since the ring's civil service loaded them, and they know their routes the way herd animals know a mountain path — waiting out obstructions, queuing at doors, pressing on through dark and cold that stop human clerks. Archivists chalk working marks on their shells as drovers brand stock, and the shells of the old calvens carry generations of marks under the current ones. Each vault's calvens answer that vault's halls; a calven led to a strange threshold stops and plants, and the archives long ago arranged their transfer stations around the fact rather than against it.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Custody and the Orphan Drawer"
    The discipline that makes calvens trustworthy makes them occasionally immovable. A case rides under the seal that loaded it, and a lost, broken, or disputed seal leaves an orphan: a case the calven keeps carrying, round after round — the one refusal in its repertoire, and the archives' phrase for an insoluble problem. Verathi's registry keeps a public list of its orphan cases with the calven each one rides; petitions to force a case require a registrar's court, a witnessed seal reconstruction, and, by long tradition, an apology addressed to the calven.

    Feeding is the minders' word for the maintenance the machines accept: cargo-bed rails dressed with wax, shells washed, legs cleared of vault grit. The mechanisms inside stay sealed, elven, and working, and the archives extend to their calvens the standing rule of all running elven equipment — the machine's routine outranks the schedule of anyone visiting it.
  PROSE

  cue "A chest-high ceramic carrier walks the vault corridor at an even, unhurried pace, sealed case in its rail bed, and queues behind two clerks at the door with visible patience."
  cue "On the registry wall hangs the orphan list — case numbers paired with calven names — and the oldest entries are written in a dead clerk's hand."
  affordance "A calven moves sealed records through dark, cold, and quarantine sections under a custody discipline courts accept as testimony — the manifest plate's record outweighs a clerk's word in every registry in the system."
  pressure "Custody runs both ways: a broken or disputed seal turns cargo into an orphan the calven carries forever, and forcing one open takes a registrar's court and a witnessed reconstruction while the record rides in circles."
  variation "Verathi runs four-case freight calvens on the register floors and posts their routes like ferry times; Thornvault's single-case couriers work the canyon vaults where a dropped case would fall a long way."
  variation "The cold-vault pattern warms its cargo bed for media that crack at depth temperatures, and the two known survivors are lent between archives under treaties with named escorts."
