  prose <<~PROSE
    A hood is a wearable dampening frame used when active Tuning would draw a #{encyclopedia_ref :hushmaw, "hushmaw"} or disturb a sensitive field. Three curved arms sit across the shoulders and behind the head. Each holds a narrow strip of ringglass above a layer of stillwater. When closed around a prepared wearer, the strips absorb the small organized changes their attention would otherwise place into local resonance.

    Deep-runners describe the effect as going under cloth. Ordinary sight, sound, balance, and touch remain. Resonance perception collapses into an even pressure without direction or detail. To learn whether the danger has passed, the wearer depends on the people around them.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "Closing the Frame"
    The hood must learn the wearer's resting response before use. The Tuner sits without practicing while another operator adjusts the three strips until their returns match. Once the frame closes, it damps changes around that baseline. A hood prepared for one person gives poor cover to another and can make the second wearer's signal more regular and easier to find.

    Each arm moves independently. Small mechanical governors keep them from settling into one repeated correction. The wearer hears the movement through the shoulder pads as soft unequal taps. When the taps synchronize, the rig has begun following an external pattern and must be opened.

    Stillwater warms as it takes the signal. Dark windows on the arms show bubbles forming in the medium. One active window is normal. Three dark windows mean the frame is near release and the wearer should already be moving toward cover.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "The Blind Interval"
    A crew prepares the retreat before closing a hood. Another person holds the physical line, watches the wearer, and decides when to reopen the frame. A decoy resonator goes out along a different course. The ship stops repeated survey pulses and varies any machine that must remain active.

    The covered Tuner leaves the field alone. Reaching for the field presses a stronger signal into the dampers and shortens the useful interval. Training concentrates on ordinary cues: line tension, hand signs, airflow, counted turns, and the movements of the escort.

    Opening happens behind physical cover or after passive observers confirm the predator took the decoy. The operator releases one arm at a time. A sudden return of direction can disorient the wearer, especially after contact with a hushmaw.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :limits, heading: "One Person's Cover"
    A hood covers one person's active perception. A kite drive, an instrument sweep, a transmitted signal and a ringglass tool in the wearer's hands all read as plainly as before, and a hushmaw that has already fixed its path on the ship keeps it. Closing the frame after contact can make the animal turn toward another active source aboard the same ship.

    Damaged stillwater compartments fail quietly. The hood may feel more comfortable as its coverage collapses. Crews inspect the dark windows, weigh each arm, and compare the mechanical stops before entering the Deep. A cracked strip is replaced as a set because three unmatched pieces can create a clean repeated pulse.

    Cheap imitations often use ordinary damping fluid and powered correction. They reduce instrument noise in a workshop. In the Deep, their shared clock produces exactly the kind of pattern the hood is meant to conceal.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "A Short Supply"
    Reports of one empty bearing across the Pell routes have raised demand for hoods. Licensed frames are being moved from training rooms and research stores into working ships. The limiting part is clean stillwater, which the #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"} also needs for records and Bloom cordons.

    Several used rigs now offered in Glasswake carry freshly painted windows and no service weights. Ratter yards have posted a simple refusal: a seller who will not open all three arms for inspection is selling furniture.
  PROSE

  cue "Licensed frames are being pulled out of training rooms and research stores to fill working ships, and clean stillwater is short because the #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"} needs the same supply. A crew wanting a hood on short notice is offered someone else's."
  cue "A deep-runner sits in the galley with three curved arms closed around her shoulders and head, eating slowly, while her partner keeps one hand on a line clipped to her belt."
  affordance "Hoods get lent, because a fitted frame sits idle whenever its own Tuner is off duty. A hood damps changes around the resting response it was fitted to, so on a borrower it can make the signal more regular and easier to find."
  pressure "Under the hood the Tuner is blind to the field, so another crew member holds the line and decides when the arms open. The wearer's one reading is the unequal tapping through the shoulder pads, and taps falling into step mean the frame has begun following something outside."
  variation "Training-room hoods are heavy fixed rigs refitted to each student in turn; working ship hoods are lighter, fitted once to one Tuner, and lent out only after a fresh fitting."
  variation "Research stores keep hoods with extra windows along each arm for watching the stillwater warm; ratter crews prefer plain rigs with one window per arm and heavier governors."
