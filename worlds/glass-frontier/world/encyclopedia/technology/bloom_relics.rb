  summary "Bloom relics are unique objects formed when a changing Bloom boundary fixes part of an ordinary object's existing function under an altered physical rule. Current workshops cannot manufacture them on demand or reliably repair their spent material."

  log "2026-08-21 — Defined Bloom relic formation as a boundary pinning one existing physical relationship into an exposed object. The effect follows the object's prior function and local conditions; repeated activation is not required."

  cue "An ordinary working object carries some mark of the boundary that crossed it: geometry that should not close, crystal that holds one narrow bandwidth with no tuning, or changed behavior that shows only under test."
  cue "No two Bloom relics are alike."
  affordance "Each relic can be tested from its old job: a seal divides, a relay carries one signal, and a bearing holds an axis under a narrower physical rule."
  pressure "Every use spends the altered material, and no workshop can restore it once spent."
  variation "Some relics carry impossible geometry or crystal that holds a narrow bandwidth without tuning."
  variation "Some are machines whose altered function emerges only through testing."

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :significance, heading: "Significance"
    Individually unique artifacts of exceptional power circulate through the system's economy as objects of extreme value. Some survive from before the Glassfall. Others form at active Bloom boundaries. Current workshops cannot manufacture either class on demand.

    **Intact ringglass** is covered in the #{encyclopedia_ref :ringglass, "ringglass entry"}: ring-era crystal whose surviving configurations exceed current replication methods.

    **#{ref :bloom_zones, "Bloom Zone"} relics** form when ordinary material is caught across a changing boundary. They include impossible geometry, crystals that hold narrow bandwidths without tuning, and machines whose altered function emerges only through testing. The #{ref :karet_spool, "Karet Spool"}, a freight winch whose finite line preserves one traversed route through changing space, has a documented recovery and custody record.

    **Named relics** circulate through official custody, private collections, and black-market catalogues. Claims include books that improve their readers' fortune and a spear said to pass through every tested material. Neither claim has a public chain of custody comparable to the Karet Spool. Buyers pay for demonstrated behavior, credible provenance, or the chance that a story will survive examination.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :mechanics, heading: "Formation"
    A forming relic begins with an object whose parts already sustain a coherent relationship: a winch holds tension along a line, a seal keeps two pressures apart, a relay carries one signal, a bearing constrains motion around an axis. When a Bloom boundary crosses the object, the changing geometry can pin that relationship while the surrounding material changes.

    The altered object continues what it was doing under a narrower and less ordinary rule. A pinned seal may divide spaces that no longer meet cleanly. A relay may hold one frequency after its transmitter is gone. The effect does not grant an unrelated ability, and it ends where the object's surviving material can no longer carry the relationship.

    Formation follows the object's structure, the load on it, and the local boundary. Those conditions make the result patterned without making it predictable. Two identical machines exposed at different moments can produce different relics; most exposed objects produce none. Unlike intact ring-era equipment, a Bloom relic is accidental, tied to one site and event, and rarely repairable once its altered material is spent.
