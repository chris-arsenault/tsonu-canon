  summary "Seren blue is a live medicinal soil whose fungal nodules guide sensation back through damaged nerves."

  cue "Cobalt fungal hairs thread the dark soil, and the mature mold forms pale nodules along the bed's tone lines."
  cue "A shipment includes live loam, dried nodules, and a scored ceramic bar carrying the bed's cultivation tone."
  affordance "Apothecaries steep the nodules into a paste that encourages sensation to return from a damaged nerve outward."
  pressure "A stressed culture sends rapid pulses through nearby tissue and can keep a patient awake for several days."
  variation "Seren's stock has divided into two stable forms with the same appearance and recorded ancestry."
  variation "Loam offered away from Seren moved before the exchange lot closed, and its ceramic bar may have been cracked or swapped in transit."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Cobalt fungal hairs thread the dark soil sold as Seren blue. Growers at #{ref :seren, "Seren"} keep it in shallow warm beds and feed it powdered root, saline water, and a slow structural tone. The mature mold forms pale nodules along the tone lines.

    Apothecaries steep those nodules into a paste applied around damaged nerves. A steady culture encourages sensation to return from the injury outward. A stressed culture sends rapid pulses through nearby tissue and can keep a patient awake for several days.

    A shipment includes live loam, dried nodules, and a scored ceramic bar carrying the bed's cultivation tone.

    Seren's stock has divided into two stable forms while retaining the same appearance and recorded ancestry. The exchange lot remains closed while matched cultures establish which form a shipment carries.
