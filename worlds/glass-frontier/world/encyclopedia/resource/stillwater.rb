  cue "Stillwater is carried in sealed vials with crystal particulate suspended through the purified water."
  cue "A vial offered outside Conclave supply may still contain the original Echo River voices."
  affordance "A vial of stillwater can hold more data than a conventional crystal array ten times its size."
  pressure "Heat, contamination, a resonance spike, or a broken seal corrupts the contents. The damage becomes legible only when a Tuner reads the vial back."
  variation "Clean stillwater has been filtered of its accidental historical content while retaining its signal-band capacity."
  variation "Black-market stillwater retains original Echo River voices and commands extreme prices from collectors."

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :how_it_works, heading: "How It Works"
    Stillwater begins as #{encyclopedia_ref :echo_rivers, "Echo River"} water carrying pre-Glassfall signal imprints in suspended crystal. Filtration removes those accidental records, and resonance stabilization leaves a clear medium able to accept new signal-band information.

    A vial holds more data than a conventional crystal array ten times its size because the particulate provides storage surfaces throughout the water's volume. Signal-band Tuning writes and reads the medium. Heat, contamination, resonance spikes, and a broken seal alter the lattice; the loss becomes legible at the next readback.

    The #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"} consumes most of the clean supply. The #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"} uses it for custodian outputs that lose information when transferred to conventional media. Black-market vials retaining their original Echo River voices command much higher prices from collectors.
