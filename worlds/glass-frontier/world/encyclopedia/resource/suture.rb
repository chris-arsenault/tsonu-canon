  summary "Suture is the living leak dressing of the hab trades: a woven mat of cultured fiber that tightens around escaping fluid and changes color when the leak carries a signal charge. Every pressure kit stows a roll, and the weave's verdict on a leak arrives faster than any gauge."
  function "Emergency leak dressing that self-tightens on contact with escaping fluid and color-codes the leak's charge"
  grades "Fresh-roll for the kits, cistern-grade for standing repairs, and the spent gray mats that go to the training rooms"
  availability "Cultured in wet-frame beds at Ravel, Tanel, and Issel; rolls trade through every hab chandlery and cordon store"

  prose <<~PROSE
    A hab leak is a race between the fluid and the crew, and suture is the trades' standing head start. The mats are cultured at Ravel's wet-frames — a living fiber raised in the settlement's mineral plume — and a roll slapped over a leak does two jobs in the same breath: the weave drinks the escaping fluid and cinches, a live tightening that follows the leak's own pressure, and the silk's color announces what the fluid carries. Plain water leaves the weave linen-pale. A line carrying signal charge blushes the silk to deep blue within a breath, and the blush is the material's real gift: the difference between a plumber's job and a #{encyclopedia_ref :signal_folding, "folder"}-and-tuner job, decided at a glance, before anyone has put a hand where a charged line could teach them better.

    The rolls live in every pressure kit, cordon store, and engine room in the ring settlements, wrapped in wax against their own drying. Fresh rolls go to emergency kits, aging rolls to standing repairs, and spent gray mats to training rooms where apprentices practice the slap-and-read on rigged leak walls. Ravel's wet-frame beds supply the system, and the culture travels under living-cargo rules with lineage and second-habitat records. Demand regularly exceeds the rate at which the beds can grow fresh mat.
  PROSE

  cue "The kit roll goes over the spraying seam wet-side down, cinches visibly into the leak like a fist closing, and five people watch the weave for the blush."
  cue "In the training room, a rigged wall of practice leaks wears a patchwork of spent gray mats, and an apprentice drills the slap-and-read to a called count."
  affordance "One roll is seal and diagnosis together — a live cinch that holds until the wrights come, and a color verdict on the line's charge delivered faster than any gauge can be fetched."
  pressure "A blue blush reclassifies the repair on the spot. The crew leaves the patch in place, clears ordinary tools from the charged line, and calls a folder and Tuner for the permanent work."
  variation "Ravel's plume-fed beds grow the standard; Tanel and Issel culture hardier lines for cold holds, and kit inspectors can name a roll's bed by the weave."
  variation "Spent mats keep a faint tightening reflex, and the training rooms use them for drill walls — while hab children, to every quartermaster's resignation, prize them as the material for a toy that grips a finger."
