  log "2026-08-31 — Renamed Microcavities to Seed; the ordinary word gains a stable commodity meaning for sealed ringglass cells that carry a releasable charge."
  summary "Seed cells are sealed ringglass chambers cut to hold dense standing resonance and release it as portable high-energy fuel."

  cue "Most cells are thumbnail-sized or smaller and are traded in standardized racks."
  cue "A full rack looks like a tray of tiny glass seeds, each humming faintly if held close enough to feel."
  affordance "Cracking a cell's seal releases the stored energy as kinetic-band output, enough to restart a dead array or supply emergency thrust."
  pressure "A poorly sealed cell is a volatile hazard rather than a fuel source and can vent the whole stored charge without anyone choosing the moment."
  variation "The grade that holds charge best comes out of the Shear and costs accordingly."
  variation "Industrial processes use standardized cells where ambient resonance cannot supply enough power."

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :how_it_works, heading: "How It Works"
    Seed cells are sealed #{encyclopedia_ref :ringglass, "ringglass"} vessels cut with internal chambers that hold dense standing waves. The chamber geometry and outer seal keep the charge fixed. Cracking the seal releases it as one controlled burst of kinetic-band output.

    Deep #{ref :the_shear, "Shear"} operations, emergency thrust, and heavy industrial work use the cells when ambient resonance cannot supply enough power. Ringglass refineries cut and tune them to tight tolerances. A loose seal vents the same stored charge before the cell reaches its machine.

    Most cells are thumbnail-sized or smaller and travel in standardized racks. A full rack resembles a tray of glass seeds, each humming faintly when held close enough to feel.
