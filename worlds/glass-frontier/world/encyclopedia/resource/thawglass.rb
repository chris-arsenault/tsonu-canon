  cue "Thawglass is a porous ceramic mesh threaded with low-grade ringglass fiber."
  cue "Every piece is fired with a painted heat line showing the direction of the spring melt."
  affordance "A weak structural tone guides water to freeze on the mesh first and melt along the ceramic pores when the frame warms."
  pressure "Set against its painted line, a column freezes out of sequence and melts through the wrong face."
  variation "Heavy frame grade forms the central skeleton of Mera's seasonal ice columns."
  variation "Stair grade carries rough ribs that remain grippable under frost, while household mesh bends around cisterns and food stores."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Mera grows its seasonal ice columns around thawglass, a porous ceramic mesh threaded with ringglass fiber. A weak structural tone moves through the fibers. Water freezes there first and binds the column to its frame, then melts along the ceramic pores when the frame warms.

    Heavy frame grade forms the central skeleton. Stair grade carries rough ribs that remain grippable under frost. Household mesh bends around cisterns and food stores. Every grade is fired with a painted heat line showing the direction of the spring melt.

    Used pieces return to Mera's kilns after the thaw.

    A frame that freezes out of sequence develops clear fibers along one edge. Kiln crews crush it into household mesh, whose short fibers cannot steer a public column far enough to threaten its water schedule.
