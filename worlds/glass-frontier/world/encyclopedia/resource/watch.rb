  summary "Watch is the sharp-smelling wake-up standard of the system's kits: a pressed mineral tablet crushed under the nose to cut through cold, exhaustion, and lender's shakes for one clear hour. Every watch post, route chest, and midwife's bag carries the tablets, mixed to the old evacuation formula."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The kit that held the #{encyclopedia_ref :ration_lamp, "ration lamp"} held a flat tin beside it, and the tin's descendants are in every working pocket in the system. Watch comes as a pressed mineral tablet, thumbnail-sized and scored for halving: crushed between the fingers and held under the nose, the smell cuts through cold-watch drowse, the third shift of a flood emergency, or a lender's post-lend shakes, and buys one level, wakeful hour. The formula rode in the ring's evacuation stores and passed into the public pharmacopoeia during the Rekindling — a deliberate act, recorded with its reasoning, by custodians who wanted the wake-up standard everywhere and cheap forever — and apothecaries everywhere mix to it, stamping their tins with a mixer's mark the way roperies mark line.

    The trades built their rotation customs around the hour. Cordon watches run half-cut tablets on the turn, cold-route crews issue tins with the manifest, midwives and lenders keep full-cut for the long nights, and the phrase 'a two-salt night' does duty across the system for any stretch of work that earned its exhaustion honestly. The tablet's limits are as standardized as its virtues: the hour ends on schedule, the spent rest stands as debt, and watch discipline everywhere caps the run at two before sleep stops being a suggestion.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :trade, heading: "Mixers, Marks, and the Boring Price"
    Keeping Watch boring is settled policy. The minerals are common, the pharmacopoeia formula is public, and the registries prosecute corner-cutting mixers under food law rather than trade law — a decision old enough that its reasoning survives as proverb: the tin that fails is the watch that fails. Mixer's marks carry reputations the way ropery marks do, and districts develop loyalties; a Keelward dock tin and a Kyther valley tin hold the same formula and different presses, and crews swear by the crumb of their own.

    The household press, milder and sold loose at any counter, does the civilian work: market mornings, harvest weeks, the first watch of a new parent. Custom gives Watch as a small serious gift — a tin in a traveler's pack, a tin at a birth — and an empty tin kept in a pocket is the system's quiet badge for a hard stretch survived, refilled by friends who notice.
  PROSE

  cue "The watch turns over at the cold hour: the incoming stander crushes a half-tablet under their nose, breathes three times, and takes the rail with settled hands."
  cue "A flat tin with a mixer's mark passes across the counter as change for a favor, and both parties treat the exchange as fully legible."
  affordance "One tablet is a level hour on demand — the difference between a manned watch and an empty one, a steady lender and a second casualty — and the public formula means the tin in a stranger's pocket is the same medicine as the tin in yours."
  pressure "Each tablet postpones rest for one hour, and crews enforce a two-salt cap. A stander preparing a third is relieved on the spot and sent to sleep."
  variation "Cordon and route trades issue half-cut tins on the manifest and log usage; households buy the mild press loose and spend it on harvests, births, and market mornings."
  variation "Mixer loyalties run deep enough that crews trade tins on routes the way they trade news, and a district's favorite press is defended with the seriousness elsewhere reserved for bread."
