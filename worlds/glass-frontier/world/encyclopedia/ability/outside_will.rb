  effect "Compel one person, creature, or machine that receives and understands the words to perform one immediate, physically possible action"
  limits "The spell supplies neither knowledge nor skill, cannot establish a standing order, and follows the subject's literal understanding rather than the practitioner's unspoken intent"
  consequence "One recent autobiographical memory becomes inaccessible until the action ends; if the subject resists the command, that memory does not return"

  prose <<~PROSE
    Three Forms teaching calls the spell *Outside Will*: Will imposed from beyond a subject's own Form. One person, creature, or machine receives one command to perform one immediate act. The command must be heard or otherwise received, understood, and physically possible. It can stop a hand in mid-strike, turn one mounted weapon, or make a constructed servant open the place it guards.

    Outside Will provides obedience rather than competence. A subject ordered to fly a vessel cannot do so without the relevant skill. A machine ordered to identify a liar cannot answer unless it has a way to make that judgment. The spell cannot wait as policy or standing instruction: when the immediate act ends, so does the command.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :limits, heading: "The Price of Authority"
    Casting Outside Will closes one recent autobiographical memory to the practitioner: the last meal, a route walked that morning, the reason a tool was in hand. The memory returns when the compelled act ends unless the subject resisted. Resistance makes the absence permanent even when the command succeeds.

    #{ref :red_sovereign, "The Red Sovereign"} extends Outside Will into standing and collective command, with a cost that follows the betrayals it compels.
