  name "Pinning"
  summary "Pinning is the everyday craft of securing things against a world that moves them — lashing to the elves' built-in pin points, tying holds that release with one pull, and rigging a room for recoil, tide, or spin change in the minutes a warning allows. Hab children learn it before table manners."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The system's worlds move their contents — #{encyclopedia_ref :mareth_recoil, "recoil"} at the gates, #{encyclopedia_ref :ravel_tides, "tides"} on the relay fragments, spin drift, rough transit, the ordinary lurches of corridor life — and pinning is the craft that answers, practiced so universally it is taught before table manners. The material half is elven: ring-built surfaces carry pin points everywhere, recessed rings and rails set into decks, walls, bunks, and benches with the thoroughness other builders spend on door handles, and daily use since the ring's own era has kept the standard fittings standard. The human half is the hitches — the small vocabulary of holds every hab hand's hands know: the standing lash for cargo, the one-pull hold for what must release in a breath, the body line that keeps a sleeper in a bunk through a bad night without trapping them in a fire.

    The craft's grammar is the declared rig. A room is pinned *for* something — for recoil, for tide, for transit — and the declaration governs the hitches chosen, because the holds that ride out a corridor snap are the wrong holds for a slow tide's patient pull. Warning customs plug straight into the craft: the horn count at Mareth, the lean at Ravel, the storm bells everywhere are all, practically, pinning orders, and the minutes they buy are spent in the fixed circuits households drill — hook, lash, tension, test, the flat-palm shove that proves each hold — until a family can rig its rooms in the time a kettle takes and does, wordlessly, at the first note.
  PROSE

  cue "At the warning note the household moves in a practiced circuit — hook, lash, tension, the flat-palm shove on each hold — and the room is rigged before the kettle the youngest was told to mind comes off its hook."
  cue "Every bench, bunk, and doorway carries the recessed rings of the old pin points, polished by generations of hitches, and a traveler's hand finds them in the dark of any hab in the system."
  affordance "A pinned room rides out what the warning named — and the standard points and hitches mean any hab hand can rig any hab's rooms, which makes pinning the one craft a traveler carries that works identically everywhere the elves built."
  pressure "A rig carries only its declared load. Recoil, tide, and spin change require different hitches, and body lines or emergency gear require one-pull releases that stay reachable under load."
  variation "Gate districts drill recoil rigs to the horn and pride themselves on kettle-time; the tide fragments rig standing and live half-lashed always, and their guests are re-taught which chairs are load-bearing."
  variation "Carrier crews certify pinning like lending, and a crew's rig is inspected by the flat-palm shove of any member at any time — a custom whose etiquette, whose shove is a compliment and whose is a challenge, takes newcomers a season to read."
