  prose <<~PROSE
    The intact ring cast one shadow, a steady band the old surface almanacs call the ribbon, and the surface lived under its single daily crossing. The broken ring casts many. The larger surviving fragments — the inhabited arcs, the great dead spans — cross Kaleidos's star on their orbits and send their shadows over the land as passings: minutes of moving dusk that arrive on schedule, to the breath, generation after generation. Light softens, heat eases, the #{encyclopedia_ref :gleeds, "gleeds"} brighten on glassy ground, and then full day slides back from the west edge of the shade.

    Surface life is built to the passing tables. The long midday passing is the rest in hot country and the working window for heat-shy trades — glazing, wax work, the pouring of road surface on Ashvane's cousin-climates of the Avar summer. Markets open between the paired short passings of morning, and "first shade" and "second shade" are hours in every surface town's mouth. Growers plant to the deep seasonal crossings, when a great fragment's shadow returns day after day for a span of weeks and the fields under its track get a cooler season inside the season. A settlement's passing table is its first civic document; the almanac offices of Sithari print them for every registered town, and a town's copy, posted at the well or the market bell, is annotated in local hands until the next printing.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Shade Work and Shade Custom"
    A passing is a scheduled resource: cool light twice or thrice daily, priced into labor contracts through shade-work rates for jobs that use the shadow and full-light rates for jobs that avoid it. The shadow ends as punctually as it arrives. Ashvane and Avar crews drill a walk-away time before hot-country work begins, and working households mark overruns in the almanac margin.

    Courting couples in the Sable Crescent walk the long passing. Kyther funerals time the lowering to a shade's arrival. Children race the shadow's western edge, a game also recorded in ring-era accounts of the ribbon.
  PROSE

  cue "A soft wall of dusk slides across the fields at a walking pace; workers straighten, markets pause mid-haggle, and the whole street's shadow arrives and leaves to the minute the posted table promised."
  cue "At the market bell hangs the town's passing table, printed in Sithari and annotated in three generations of local ink."
  affordance "A passing is scheduled cool and shade on open ground — the working window for heat-shy trades, the surface traveler's free rest stop, and a clock the whole countryside reads bare-eyed."
  pressure "The shade ends to the minute, so work, travel, and meetings planned inside a passing inherit a fixed deadline; overruns in hot country expose people and materials to a rapid return of full heat."
  variation "Fragment towns under a deep seasonal track get a cool growing season inside the season and plant a second crop against it; their neighbors a valley over, off the track, buy the surplus and resent the geometry."
  variation "The Sable Crescent walks its long passing for courtship and the Kyther valleys lower their dead to a shade's arrival, and both customs cite the other as the imported one."
