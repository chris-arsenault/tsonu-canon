  name "Miraeth Blue"
  summary "Miraeth blue is a pulse that travels through forest soil and gathers beneath plants carrying damaged ringglass. The forest floor glows in slow moving veins on charged nights, the light pools under afflicted trees, and the foresters cull by it."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Miraeth's forests grow through glass veins in the basin soils, and old trees take ringglass into their grain with other minerals. On charged nights, Miraeth blue moves under the leaf litter along the buried glass and gathers in steady pools beneath particular trees. Pooled trees carry cracked, delaminating, or strike-shocked glass in their grain. The light's concentration tracks damage closely enough for foresters to draw cull maps by walking the dark stands lantern-off and marking each pool.

    Cracked-glass timber fails explosively under saw and load, so glass-grain wood is culled young and Lumenshard timber law requires a current Miraeth blue survey before felling. The pulse moves along the veins at walking pace, brightens with the signal tides, and concentrates at damaged glass. Three mechanism papers draw on the same twelve seasons of maps and reproduce those correlations; each proposes a different carrier for the moving light.
  PROSE

  cue "The night forest floor carries slow blue veins under the litter, branching like fire under paper, and one old tree stands in a steady gathered pool of it."
  cue "The forestry crew's morning cull map is drawn in last night's hand, pool by pool, and the marked trees wear their chalk before the light has faded from anyone's memory."
  affordance "Pooled light identifies cracked glass in a tree's grain, allowing lantern-off surveyors to map a stand for culling before a saw reaches it."
  pressure "Each pooled tree can fail explosively under saw or load; felling crews work from the latest night survey and isolate marked timber during cutting and haulage."
  variation "Deep-basin stands pool bright and cull often; the dry ridgeline forests show Miraeth blue rarely, and their crews walk to the basin to train their eyes."
  variation "Lumenshard's night surveyors work lantern-off in pairs by long custom, and the trade's initiation — the first solo dark walk — doubles as its examination in the basin's other night hazards."
