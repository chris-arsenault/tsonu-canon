  name "Empty-Berth Fever"
  summary "Empty-Berth Fever is the social condition that takes hold among stranded passengers in a dock settlement's unused rooms — occupation hardening into fierce inherited-feeling ownership within days, complete with improvised registries and defended thresholds. Dock wardens treat an accumulating strand like weather."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Strand enough travelers in a dock settlement — a flood season, a falling year's compressed windows, a corridor closure — and the vacant rooms begin to be settled rather than occupied. Empty-berth fever is the documented pattern: within days of a strand passing the thresholds the wardens now chart, temporary occupation hardens into ownership that feels inherited. Name boards go up. Thresholds acquire mats, door customs, and defense. A corridor registry appears in someone's careful hand, disputes get their own bench, and passengers whose ships may board with the next window speak of rooms held a fortnight in the register other cultures reserve for the family stretch of a channel.

    Fevered galleries quickly establish water rotas, watch rounds, dispute benches, and threshold law. That speed has made them a standing subject for the capital's social surveys, whose literature divides over whether the fever is displacement pathology or settlement behavior observed under compression. Dock wardens chart strand size against onset, reserve staff for the clearing, and increasingly countersign the corridor registries. When traffic resumes, the ward record gives returning owners and temporary claimants one common list of rooms, occupants, and improvements from which to negotiate.
  PROSE

  cue "The stranded gallery has grown name boards, threshold mats, and a corridor registry in a careful hand, and the fortnight-resident at the third door explains the local threshold custom to a newcomer with a settler's patience."
  cue "At the ward office, the duty warden reads the strand tally against a worn chart and starts the fever paperwork before the first name board goes up."
  affordance "The fever's competence is usable — a fevered gallery polices itself, keeps its own registry, and can be governed through its improvised institutions, and docks that countersign the corridor books clear their backlogs with the registries as the peace terms."
  pressure "Traffic resumption brings returning owners to thresholds that stranded occupants now defend as homes; wardens use the countersigned corridor registry to clear rooms, value improvements, and settle competing claims."
  variation "Flood-season strands fever fast and clear clean; the long strands of falling years build galleries that survive their clearing as chartered neighborhoods, and two of Clearance Eight's wards began exactly that way."
  variation "The survey literature's two schools read the fever as pathology and as settlement's reflex respectively, and both cite Clearance Eight's chartered wards as their best evidence."
