  name "Mareth Recoil"
  summary "Mareth Recoil is the breath-long reversal of corridor pull that follows a heavy vessel's departure from a loaded freight gate — the corridor snaps back like a plank stepped off, and dock life at the great gates is choreographed around the snap."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Mareth's streets thread a Ring-era freight gate, and the gate still behaves like the piece of transit machinery it is. Its corridors carry a working pull — the engineered drift that walks freight toward the berths — and when a heavy vessel departs under load, the pull recoils. For one breath the corridor reverses, like a plank springing up behind a stepped-off foot: hung chains swing gateward, dust lifts and streams toward the departed hull, and anything unsecured takes an uninvited step toward the departed ship. The effect scales with the departure's mass, runs strongest in the great gate's main throat, and has been measured, charted, and argued over by every survey Mareth has hosted since the Rekindling.

    Dock life absorbed the recoil generations ago. The departure horn carries the count — three notes, two, then the long hold — and the hold is the town's shared reflex: carts chocked, cranes locked, walkers railed, and talk suspended with a hand raised. Gate crews time the biggest departures for shift turns, and #{ref :mareth, "Mareth"}'s children play a skipping game to the horn count that teaches the reflex before school does.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Survey Record and Mechanism"
    Recoil strength tracks departed mass on a clean curve. Corridor instruments record the reversal arriving gate-first and traveling inward at a measured speed, and three other heavy freight gates of the same Ring-era pattern show the same effect at smaller scale. Mareth's gate engineers attribute the recoil to machinery responding to the changed load. Visiting surveys treat it as a property of loaded corridors. Both models fit the present measurements, so the gate office keeps instruments on scheduled departures and publishes the readings for comparison.

    Recoil injuries cluster among newcomers who mistake the horn for ceremony. Every arriving crew receives the count at the gate door, and a resident's flat hand at the third note stops traffic until the snap passes.
  PROSE

  cue "The departure horn sounds its three-two-hold, and the whole gate district pauses on one breath — carts chocked, hands on rails, a sentence suspended — before the chains swing and the dust streams gateward."
  cue "A local's flat raised hand stops the visiting crew's cart at the third note, and the snap that follows explains the hand better than any brief."
  affordance "The recoil is charted to the departure schedule, so gate crews stage heavy or delicate work into the guaranteed still intervals — and the horn count gives every trade in the district a shared, precise clock for the day's departures."
  pressure "Every job near the gate follows the horn's hold discipline; urgent loads and walking patients must clear the throat before the count or wait until the snap passes."
  variation "Mareth's great gate runs the full horn count and civic hold; the three smaller documented gates mark departures with a bell and a painted brace-line, and their recoil is a stumble rather than a step."
  variation "Gate engineers and visiting surveys keep instruments on the same departures for opposite reasons, and the gate's tavern keeps both camps' standing graphs chalked on facing walls."
