  summary "Shedding occurs when a displaced chamber loses its contents along its former alignment. Furniture, panels, and smaller objects drop out of clear air over a charted strip of Xyloathax, heavy pieces first and loose articles for up to a day afterward. Wardens rope the lines and clear them at the warning knock."

  prose <<~PROSE
    In #{ref :xyloathax, "Xyloathax"}, displaced elven chambers sometimes lose their hold on the objects inside them. A shedding begins with knocking high in clear air along a posted fall line. Chairs, wall panels, shelving, and other loose contents then fall along the room's former alignment, with the heaviest pieces arriving first and small objects continuing for as long as a day. Wardens rope and sign every known line. The first knock triggers a sweep bell, and residents clear the strip before the heavy fall begins. Children learn the fall-zone map with the settlement's other closure drills.

    Xyloathax keeps room rolls compiled from recovered elven registries. Helmeted recovery crews log each object during the light tail of a shedding and compare furniture, fittings, and labels against those rolls. Identifying the chamber lets surveyors remove one interior from the standing-risk list and return sound ring-era goods to salvage. The remaining rooms stay mapped above their fall lines even when they have not shed for years.
  PROSE

  cue "The knocking starts high in clear air over the roped strip, the sweep bell answers, and the street empties in the practiced interval before the first chair arrives."
  cue "The recovery detail works the drizzle under helmets, logging each piece against the room rolls — a door, a lamp, a run of shelving — until the surveyor can name which chamber let go."
  affordance "Posted fall lines, the warning knock, sweep bells, and room rolls let wardens clear the street, recover useful objects, and identify which chamber has emptied."
  pressure "The lines can be charted and the hours can only be guessed, so the fall zones tax the settlement daily — roped street, rerouted traffic, drills kept sharp — against heavy minutes that arrive a few times a season."
  variation "Single sheddings along known lines are Xyloathax's routine; the great sheds after a displacement front, when whole galleries let go together, are the zone's evacuation-grade events and the room rolls' busiest weeks."
  variation "Other displacement settlements see the phenomenon at their own scales and keep Xyloathax's vocabulary — the knock, the sweep, the rolls — the way ports keep another port's flag code."
