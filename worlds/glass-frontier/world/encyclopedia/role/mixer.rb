  name "Mixer"
  summary "A mixer keeps a district's working pharmacy: pressing watch salts, compounding the pharmacopoeia standards, and grading every batch by its answer in the band. The registered mark on each tin identifies the mixer and the public quality record behind the batch."

  cue "In the shop window the pharmacopoeia stands chained open to the day's pressing, and the mixer measures aloud from it while the queue watches with proprietary attention."
  cue "The finished batch gets the fork — one clear ring against the tin, a tilted head — before the mark stamp comes down."
  affordance "The mixer's bench turns the public formulas into trustworthy tins — salts, salves, the route standards — and the mark on the lid carries the shop's whole history as warranty, checkable in any district ledger."
  pressure "Every batch carries the mixer's registered mark into route chests and cordon posts. A quality action follows that mark back to the bench and remains in its public district record."
  variation "City mixers run pressing benches with apprentices and queue custom; route-town mixers press small and trade tins along the carrier lines, and their marks travel farther than they do."
  variation "The grading fork's ring is bench doctrine — a true batch answers clean in the band — and old mixers claim to hear moisture, short-weight, and haste in a dull ring, with a court record that keeps agreeing with them."

  prose <<~PROSE
    A district mixer's shop presses and compounds the public standards — #{encyclopedia_ref :watch, "Watch"} first among them, then the salves, washes, and route medicines of the open pharmacopoeia. The formula book stands chained open on the bench where any customer can read it; the mixer measures aloud from it; and the finished tin takes the mixer's registered mark. The formula states what the batch should contain. The mark names the person who answers for this pressing.

    The bench's own instrument is the grading fork. A finished batch answers a struck fork with a ring, and the ring grades it: a true pressing answers clean in the band, and moisture, short measure, or hurried work dull the note in ways bench training makes audible. The fork test closes every pressing — one ring, a tilted head, the stamp or the scrap bin — and the trade's confidence in it is empirically earned; the registries' quality actions against marked tins have sided with the fork against fonder evidence for generations.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Marks, Districts, and Succession"
    A mark registers with the district ledger at the mixer's certification, appears on every tin the bench presses, and accrues its record — the routes that reorder, the cordon posts that specify it, the quality actions it has faced — in a public file consulted before stocking a chest. Crews request familiar presses, travelers carry their home mark across the system, and a retiring mixer leaves the district to choose among newly certified marks.

    Succession is the pressing of the first marked batch. An apprentice earns the bench through years of measured-aloud work under the open book, presses a certification batch that seniors fork-test in public, and registers a mark of their own — traditionally quoting an element of the teacher's, so a district's marks form family trees the ledgers can read backward for generations. The old mark retires with its holder, pressed once more into the final batch, which custom distributes free, tin by tin, to the households the bench has served longest.
