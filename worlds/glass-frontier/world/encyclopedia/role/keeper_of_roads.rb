  cue "A courier dresses in close-cut layers for dock cold and drum heat, with current route notes carried where the case never has to be set down."
  cue "The sealed and marked case travels with an exact recitation of every named hand that accepted or delivered it."
  affordance "Hiring a courier buys a current route through local delays and a custody chain for a small, urgent, or sensitive load."
  pressure "A courier will not open a case or accept one whose seal and custody cannot be answered for, and route knowledge decays after even a season away."
  variation "Courier loads include spoiling medicine, urgent replacement parts, short-lived pressure samples, and papers whose custody matters more than weight."
  variation "Each route has its own drums, locks, stairs, households, and counters, and passes to an apprentice who can rebuild it after disruption."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Freight moves on schedules; Keepers of Roads move what cannot wait for one. Medicine that spoils, a replacement part a settlement is down without, pressure samples that lose their value in a day, papers whose chain of custody matters more than their weight — anything small enough to carry and urgent enough to pay for travels by hand. Gaps between the #{ref :keel, "Keel"}'s manifests and local freight yards sustain the trade throughout Kaleidos.

    A keeper's standing rests on a route carried in working memory: its current locks, stairs, households, delays, and people willing to take the next case. Freight ledgers classify the work as courier service. People who entrust a case to one person through several transfers call that person its Keeper of Roads.

    The route is the trade's working unit. A courier holds one the way other trades hold a workshop: the transfer drums and their timings, the locks that stick, the stairs that beat the lift when the docks are crowded, the households and counters at either end. Route knowledge is personal and perishable. A courier who has been away a season walks their route before they carry on it again.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Custody"
    Custody gives the role its standing. Every load is accepted from a named hand and delivered to a named hand, and the courier can recite the chain afterward without notes. Payment disputes, spoiled loads, and lost cases are settled against that recitation, so a courier's memory for handoffs is examined the way another trade's ledger would be.

    The sender seals the case and the recipient opens it. Opening one in transit ends the courier's standing along the route. Cases carry marks — sender, service, sometimes the run — and an experienced dock hand reads a courier's case the way they read a ship's registry.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Routes and Apprentices"
    Routes pass by copying. An apprentice works a route from the holder's marks and timings until they can rebuild it after a missed drum or a closed lock — the test is recovery, not repetition, since no route survives a season unchanged. A courier who retires hands the route to the apprentice who can rebuild it, and the households along the way learn a new face carrying the same custody habits.

    Standing is local: the counters, wards, and dock offices along a route know their courier, and a stranger claiming the route is asked about its details by people who walk it daily. Between settlements the trade runs on the same verification — a courier arriving at #{ref :keelward, "Keelward"} with a case from the ring is asked who handed it over, and the answer is checked.
