  name "Descender"
  summary "A descender is a hired mourner who sings a household's grief at funerals in the descending modes the elves left behind — a voice trained to carry loss into the bands on the family's behalf, so the bereaved can stand silent and still be heard. The small itinerant trade is booked by letter and recognized through standing letters from households served."

  cue "The gray figure stands apart from the funeral colors at the grave's foot, waits for the family's nod, and opens the descent — the long falling line with the dead's names set into it — while the household stands silent and counted as heard."
  cue "The descender's interview the evening before: the fixed gentle questions, the family answering in fragments, and the mode book open on the table gaining a name, a trade, a habit worth a falling phrase."
  affordance "A descender gives a grieving household a voice it can hire when its own has failed — the loss sung formally into the bands, the elven descents lending the weight of the oldest mourning forms anyone knows, and the family freed to stand still."
  pressure "Household interviews, hand-copied mode books, and letters from earlier clients establish a descender's standing. A family hears its own names and account in the descent and may withhold a standing letter when the rendering is inaccurate."
  variation "City descenders work from standing rooms near the burial grounds and keep the great households' cords; route descenders ride circuits by letter, and thin country books them the way it books the route midwife — well ahead, against hoped-against dates."
  variation "The descents vary by lineage of teacher — each descender's mode books are hand-copied from a master's and annotated for a working life — and two descenders meeting compare books the way pilots compare charts."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The #{encyclopedia_ref :elves, "elves"} sang their dead down. Their passing-forms — long descending modes, recorded at the abandonment sites and in the archives' deep stock — are the oldest mourning music in Kaleidos, and the descender's trade descends from the Famine-generation singers who learned the forms off the recordings and sang them at the mass funerals of years when grief outran every household's strength. The craft that survives is intimate rather than mass: a descender is engaged by letter, interviews the family the evening before with the trade's fixed gentle questions, sets the dead's names and works and habits into a descent chosen from the hand-copied mode books, and at the funeral sings the household's loss on its behalf — the falling line carrying into the bands what the family, standing silent at the grave, is thereby counted as having said.

    Undyed gray against every local funeral color marks the descender as hired voice rather than kin. The client household's cord, worn at the wrist for the day and returned with the fee's receipt, marks whose grief is being rendered. Letters of standing from households served certify a descender between towns. The family supplies names and memories at the interview; the descender repeats the account back before setting it in the mode. The profession states the arrangement in its oldest saying: the elves left the forms and left, so someone has to be home to sing them.
