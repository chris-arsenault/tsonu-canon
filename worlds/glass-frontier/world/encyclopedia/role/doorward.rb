  name "Doorward"
  summary "A doorward keeps a settlement's sealed sections: holds the opening sequences, maintains the boundary lines, runs the in-and-out board for every entry, and keeps the register of what the dead decks hold. The office descends from the stewards who sealed the doors in the first place."

  cue "At the threshold to the dark section hangs a slate board of names and marks, and a figure with a loop of tagged markers is updating it at reading pace while a salvage crew waits with visible patience."
  cue "The ward's chain carries a tag for every sealed door in the charge, and the tags are worn smooth in the order the rounds walk them."
  affordance "The doorward's board and register turn the dead decks from a void into an inventory — who is inside right now, what each section holds, and which door's sequence opens for which authority — and rescue parties, salvage courts, and registrars all build on that record."
  pressure "Every entry passes one person's judgment at one threshold, so the doorward stands where salvage money, family claims, and safety custom collide — and a ward who opens too easily or too rarely is the district's favorite argument."
  variation "Great habs run warded thresholds in shifts under a senior ward with deputies; a small fragment's doorward keeps the board between other work and wears the chain at festivals."
  variation "Some wards inherit the office with the family holding; others stand for election among the crews that use the doors, and the two traditions disagree about which produces the stricter board."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Every settled fragment carries sealed sections, dark decks, and halls closed at the Glassfall or the Famine. The doorward is the office that keeps them — descended, in most habs, from the stewards who did the original sealing and stayed on as keepers of what they had closed. The charge is fourfold and posted at the threshold: hold the opening sequences, keep the boundary lines fresh, run the board, and keep the register. The sequences are #{encyclopedia_ref :knocking, "knocking"} at its most serious, taught mouth to hand to one successor. The lines are #{encyclopedia_ref :lining, "liner's"} work at boundary strength. The board names everyone behind the doors; the register states what each section holds and who may open it.

    Rescue services require every entrant to a sealed section to pass the doorward, take a marker, and return it. The board at any hour states exactly who is behind the doors. Claims are filed against register lines; family petitions cite them; and when a section is opened by court order or council vote, the doorward reads the seal entry aloud at the threshold before working the sequence.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "The Ward's Judgment"
    The office holds power in the narrow way of thresholds. A doorward rules on entries — the salvage crew with papers, the grieving family with claims, the surveyor with credentials and curiosity — against the register, the safety custom, and the ward's own knowledge of what the dark side of the door has done before. The unhurried pace is doctrine: entries process at reading speed, queues form, and the trade's saying holds that a doorward hurried is a doorward skipped. Appeals run to the council or the court, and the ward's logged reasoning goes with them, so the office keeps registers on itself as carefully as on its doors.

    Succession is the tender point. The sequences and the register pass to one successor, chosen and trained over years, and a doorward dying suddenly leaves the district counting what the office held in one head. The habs answer variously — deputy wards, sealed sequence copies in the archive, the Verathi custom of paired wards who each hold half the deep sequences — and every arrangement is a compromise between the office's security and its mortality, argued at every succession since the first steward locked the first door and stayed to keep it.
