  name "Drover"
  summary "A drover moves other people's herds along the seasonal roads, pooling small households' stock into one drive, reading ground and weather for the route, and answering for every animal at the far-end count. The drove calendar structures the surface year."

  cue "A single herd of mixed marks flows down the drove road behind one belled lead animal, and a walker on the flank thumbs the knotted cords at her belt, counting under her breath."
  cue "At the pens, households hand over stock and receive a knot on a cord in return, and the whole transaction is the knot."
  affordance "Pooling under a drover turns a dozen households' scattered stock into one professionally moved drive, and the drover's route book knows the season's ground, water and passings better than any single farm can."
  pressure "An owner with a buyer waiting at the descent fair wants the drive across a ford that ran green last week, a day ahead of the safe crossing; a drover who refuses costs twelve households the fair price, and one who agrees answers at the far-end count for every animal the ford takes."
  variation "Avar drives run to the shifting roads with spider support at the fords; garden-hab circuits are walked drives of small stock between habs, timed to dock schedules."
  variation "The great seasonal drives end in descent fairs, with stock paraded through town, the lead beast garlanded and accounts settled at the pens, and towns compete over whose fair the drovers prefer."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Surface stock moves with the seasons. #{encyclopedia_ref :marn, "Marn"} go up to the high grazing after the melt and come down again ahead of the storms; breeding stock moves between districts and market animals to the fairs. Most households own six animals and no time to walk them. A drover pools the district's stock into one drive, walks it the season's route and answers for the count at the far end. A dozen owners' marks travel as one herd behind one belled lead animal, each household's tally knotted on a cord at the drover's belt, and the knots are the contract.

    Route reading is most of the craft. A drover's book holds the season's ground: which fords ran green last month, which slopes carry darkening #{encyclopedia_ref :resonance_lichen, "lichen"} and are due a strike, where the water is and what it cost last year. The day's plan folds in the #{encyclopedia_ref :passings, "passing tables"}, since a drive rests through the long shade and makes distance in the cool that follows. Animals learn the drive bell on the first day and follow it through weather that scatters lesser herds. Drovers guard their bell's tone as a trade asset and pass it, with the route book, to the successor who buys or inherits the round.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :dangers, heading: "The Road Between"
    A drive is a slow, valuable target in open country. Rustlers cut animals off the tail in the long shade, when the drover's flank-walkers are resting; farmers whose fields border the drove road impound strays that wander into their grain and sell them back at the pens. Strikes on lichen ground, green fords and early snow on the high passes kill more animals than thieves do, and they kill drovers too. The flank-walkers are mostly young, hired at the last fair for bed, food and a share of the fee, and a drover who loses one in a ford carries the news to the family before collecting a single payment.

    Drovers steal too. An animal slipped off the drive at night can be sold to a farm off the route with its horn sheath freshly cut, and the ford takes the blame at the count. Owners who suspect it send a child along as a flank-walker the next season, and they take a refusal as a confession.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Counts, Losses, and the Fairs"
    The far-end tally is the drover's whole reputation. Stock is counted against the cords in front of the owners, and the drover recites the losses first, unprompted, cause by cause, ford, strike, sickness, with the evidence carried when evidence can be carried: a cut horn sheath, a hide, a neighbor who saw the strike. A drover whose recitals hold up over years can borrow against the next season's fees. One caught improving a story walks routes farther from home each year until the routes run out.

    The great seasonal drives end in public. Descent fairs meet the autumn drives at the market towns, with stock paraded through the streets, the lead beast garlanded in dried grass and ribbon, and accounts settled at the pens over two loud days of roast marn, fermented milk and dancing in the pen lanes. The fairs double as the surface's hiring season. Households judge next year's drovers by this year's counts, and young flank-walkers stand where the judging can see them.
