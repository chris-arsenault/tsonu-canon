  prose <<~PROSE
    The #{ref :keel, "Keel"}'s length is strung with emergency bells — the corridor's old distress net, one bell to a section, rung for the hull failures and dockings-gone-wrong that corridor life supplies steadily — and the crews rostered to answer each bell became, over generations, each other's family. Keel Route Kin count kinship by the rota. Crews answering the same bell are kin; crews on adjoining bells are cousins. A person introduces themselves by bell and rota with the precision other cultures spend on lineage, naming the crews expected to answer them and the crews they must answer in turn.

    The reckoning underneath is the answered-alarm ledger, kept in memory and recited on occasions. Every answer is remembered — who came, how fast, what it cost — and the ledger binds without balancing: bell-kinship is owed forward, to the next alarm, rather than paid back. The rota answers strangers with the same speed it answers kin, since every Route family was once the strange hull the bell rang for. Marriages between rotas merge ledgers in a ceremony built around their recitation. Children enter their household's bell at naming. When age takes a crew off the rota, the retiring crew rings its own bell once, softly, and every answering crew sounds in turn.
  PROSE

  cue "An introduction runs 'Third Bell, Hinge Six rota' before any name, and the listener's nod places the speaker on a map of obligations both parties can navigate blind."
  cue "A bell sounds down the corridor and four crews drop what they hold mid-sentence — the rota answering — while everyone else clears the route with practiced speed."
  affordance "The bell net is the corridor's rescue service and its kinship system in one — any hull in trouble on the Keel is minutes from crews whose culture counts the answering as family business, stranger and kin alike."
  pressure "The rota recites who answered, how quickly, and at what cost; slow answers remain in the ledger alongside the rescues and are carried into every later merger of bell-kin."
  variation "Dense sections run rotas of six crews with formal reciters; the long lonely spans between waystations run two-crew bells whose kinship is correspondingly fierce."
  variation "Retirement off the rota is marked by the soft self-rung bell and the whole rota's answer, and corridor travelers who witness one describe it for years."
