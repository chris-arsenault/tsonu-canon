  name "Quiet Shift"
  summary "The quiet shift is the custom that ends a trade apprenticeship: the seniors hang their tools and leave mid-shift, and the apprentice discovers that everything alive or burning in the building is theirs to keep for one full cycle."

  prose <<~PROSE
    An apprenticeship in most Kaleidos trades ends when the seniors walk out. The day is theirs to choose and they choose it silently; the apprentice looks up from a task and the shop is quiet, the tools are hung, and the kiln, the vat, the graft bed, the tuned frame — whatever in that trade must be tended continuously or die — is now theirs for a full working cycle. Passing requires the apprentice to keep the work alive, the doors open, and the usual customers served until the seniors return. The shift's length depends on what is being kept: one firing at a kiln, one watering cycle in a garden hab, one full accession-and-sealing round in an archive.

    Pre-Famine trade registers record ordinary journeyman examinations. The quiet shift dates from the Famine years, when the #{encyclopedia_ref :elves, "elves"} vanished from their workshops between one shift and the next — benches found with work laid out, firings half-run, cultures still warm — and the apprentices who kept those works alive became the surviving practitioners. Shops survived where an apprentice remained at the work. When the trades rebuilt their rules in the Rekindling, they adopted that full-cycle continuity as the examination.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "What Counts as Passing"
    Passing is continuity. A firing may come out flawed and a graft may need reseeding, but the work must still be alive and the shop still answering its door when the seniors return. The one absolute failure is abandonment — an apprentice who goes for help has ended their own shift, and most trades make them start the waiting again from the next season.

    Whether the seniors may come back early is the argument every trade has and every trade keeps open. Emergencies happen. A shop two streets from a cordon bell will empty for the bell, quiet shift or not, and most masters hold that a shift interrupted by genuine catastrophe simply resumes. A minority of shops stage a small crisis on purpose — a supplier who fails to arrive, a customer with an impossible order — and the rest of the trade considers them to be missing the point.

  cue "A workshop is open and working but wrong: the seniors' aprons folded on the benches, their tools hung, and one young person running every station alone at speed."
  cue "Regular customers order simpler than usual and pay the asking price, and the room's talk stays on the weather and the work."
  affordance "Anyone who has stood a quiet shift can be trusted with the shop, and hiring crews verify the claim by asking what was kept alive and for how long — an answer the trade can test in two questions."
  pressure "Most trades suspend a quiet shift when a cordon bell or other public emergency empties the shop; stricter shops count any departure as failure, so apprentices learn the local rule before the day arrives."
  variation "Garden habs run the shift across a full watering cycle, kilns across a single firing, and archives across one accession-and-sealing round, so its length is the trade's own clock."
  variation "A few shops stage a failed delivery or impossible order as part of the shift; most trades test only the ordinary working cycle."
