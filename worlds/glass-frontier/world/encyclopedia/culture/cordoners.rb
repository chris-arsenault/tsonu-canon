  prose <<~PROSE
    Cordon services teach their warning palette through nursery songs. Once a child can walk, the household stitches the current safe routes into sleeves and hems and resews them whenever the boundary shifts. Children repeat the day's colors at the doorway, follow closure bells, and hear #{encyclopedia_ref :ache, "sensitives"} grade an approaching emission. During #{encyclopedia_ref :still_mornings, "still mornings"}, families walk the safe lines and report damaged marks or changed ground.

    Adults raised at a cordon carry those practices into other settlements: they check posted colors, count exits, and ask where the current line lies before entering boundary ground. Many boundary services treat the childhood as part of a recruit's training, though cordon children also enter every other trade. Those who leave often retire the route stitching to a drawer and wear it again at weddings. At home, households report changes, update the clothes, and teach the next child the route they will use that week.

  cue "The guest is greeted in the doorway with the day's colors and the safe lines, stated once and plainly, and the household relaxes a visible degree when she repeats them back in order."
  cue "At the kitchen table, a parent unpicks last month's route stitching from a small sleeve while the child traces the new safe line before it is sewn."
  affordance "Boundary services treat cordon-raised recruits as already trained in warning colors, closure bells, route updates, and threshold procedure."
  variation "Standing-cordon towns raise the full discipline with the services' palette; bloom-adjacent farm country keeps a lighter version — colors, lines, and the doorway greeting — scaled to a quieter boundary."
  variation "The diaspora keeps the identity in customs — retired stitching worn at weddings, the doorway exchange between placed accents — and the services' recruiters work the scattered cordon-raised harder than any academy."
