  prose <<~PROSE
    Sitharians grew from #{ref :sithari, "Sithari"}, the system's de facto capital, and carry their civic forms through its schools, offices, courts, and trading houses. During the Rekindling, the city became a center of contact between the surface and returning ring settlements. Its formal register and record practices became common wherever institutions needed to work across jurisdictions.

    A Sitharian identity may name upbringing in the capital region, education in one of its institutions, or a household that keeps the register abroad. These sources overlap without being identical. A person raised in Sithari knows ward and office practice as local life; a diplomat trained elsewhere may speak the register perfectly and claim no capital household at all.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aesthetics, heading: "What It Looks Like"
    Formal Sitharian dress favors clean lines, layered cloth, muted natural tones, and precise accents of color. Fine garments show their cost in the fabric, the fit, and repairs worked invisibly into the original seam. Work and neighborhood dress vary by ward, trade, and household.

    Public architecture in the capital heartland uses engineered crystal and stone, resonance-integrated services, and broad spaces organized by proportion rather than dense ornament. Some civic buildings date to the Rekindling, and their continued use is a point of public pride.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :language, heading: "Language"
    The Sithari register is the system's default formal mode. Accord documents use its conventions, diplomatic communications follow its forms, and system-wide trade contracts draw on its legal vocabulary. Schools and offices across the system therefore teach it to people with no Sitharian household or upbringing.

    The register favors subordinate clauses, explicit qualifications, and measured cadence. A concession, refusal, or condition may sit inside the clause that identifies the governing record. Negotiations with speakers trained in shorter working registers often pause to restate which clause carries the decision.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :values, heading: "Politics"
    Sitharian factions span conflicting governance philosophies and political movements. They file through shared institutions, cite the same public records, and argue over which office owns an exception. The common procedure makes disagreement portable: a ward dispute and an Accord hearing can use the same record vocabulary while reaching different decisions.

    Sitharian political thinkers did much of the early work on the Tempered Accord. Its public trail, repeatable hearings, and reliance on good-faith participation reflect capital practice. Settlements elsewhere adopt many of the forms and continue to dispute which Sitharian assumptions traveled inside them.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :perception, heading: "Capital Standing Abroad"
    A capital credential opens archives, courts, and professional registries far from Sithari. It also tells a local office which forms and assumptions the visitor is likely to bring. A delegation that offers a Sitharian procedure as neutral help may be heard as trying to set the terms of the dispute; another settlement may request the same procedure because every party can already read its record.

    Sitharian travelers vary their introductions accordingly. An officeholder may lead with the capital post at a hearing and use a local working name at the yard outside. The choice announces which standing the visitor expects to use before the business is stated.
