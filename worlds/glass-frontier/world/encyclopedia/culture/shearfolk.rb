  cue "A Shearfolk introduction gives a working name, the present vessel or station, and the last route whose conditions the speaker can answer for."
  cue "Clothes show repair thread at cuffs, knees, and shoulders, while tools carry stamped chains of owners across several ports."
  affordance "A current route, rescue record, or ownership chain identifies who can confirm a chart, a tow, a debt, or a borrowed tool."
  pressure "A crew that abandons another ship loses bunks, guides, and buyers, and every person transferring away carries the abandonment on their record."
  variation "Shearfolk grow up aboard salvage ships, at claim stations, and in route settlements, often moving between several crews."
  variation "Family names govern households and inheritance, while working names change with the vessel or station that can answer for a person's work."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Shearfolk are people raised aboard salvage ships, claim stations, and route settlements across the #{ref :the_shear, "Shear"}. A person may spend a childhood moving between crews and still meet familiar hands at Brake, a Compact office, or a deep-route shelter. The shared culture rests on current route knowledge, visible work, and rescue debts that pass from one crew to the next.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :values, heading: "Crew Credit"
    A crew's standing begins with the people and vessels it has brought home. Claim yield matters, but a rich crew that abandons another ship loses bunks, guides, and buyers. Rescue obligations are recorded beside work shares. A person who transfers crews carries both records.

    Shearfolk introductions name a working name, present vessel or station, and the last route on which the speaker can answer for conditions. Family names remain important in households and inheritance. Work names govern the first exchange because they identify who can confirm a chart, a tow, or a debt.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aesthetics, heading: "What Travels"
    Clothing is layered for pressure changes and marked at cuffs, knees, and shoulders with repair thread visible from across a work bay. A replaced panel keeps the color of the crew that fitted it until the next complete overhaul. Tools carry short chains of stamped owners, allowing a borrowed cutter or sounding weight to find its way back across several ports.
