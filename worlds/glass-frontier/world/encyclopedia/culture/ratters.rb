  prose <<~PROSE
    Ratters are independent salvage crews of #{ref :the_shear, "the Shear"}. They form the working majority by ship count and the minority by tonnage: small crews, fast ships, and marginal profits spread across hundreds of vessels. Ratter crews pioneered Shear salvage in the 2320s and have worked alongside the larger operations of #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"} and the #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} through several economic eras.

    The name began as an insult and became the crews' ordinary working term. Crew tattoos, first-claim pendants, and Shear-cant now give it a visible and audible meaning at any salvage port.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Flotillas"
    The basic operational unit is the **flotilla**: a loose grouping of independent ships working a Shear region together under a senior captain known as a **long-rat**. Each ship retains its own command and joins the flotilla through shared charts, rescue obligations, and brokerage contacts. A long-rat earns the position through regional knowledge, reliable market contacts, fair dispute work, and a rescue record other captains trust.

    A flotilla shares forecasting data, debris-mass charts, navigation hazards, current Coremark and Compact movements, fence contacts, ship-doctor referrals, and news of debts. Hauls, claims, ship maintenance, and crew remain with the individual ship. The flotilla coordinates routes and rescue; the ships conduct the salvage.

    Flotillas form around a working region, a shared route, or access to the same brokers and repair berths. They split when that work moves and recombine when rescue coverage or a large claim requires more ships. Some have worked under four long-rats in a decade; others have carried the same person's calls for #{duration 30}.

    A typical Ratter ship runs three to six crew. The largest carry ten or twelve and operate as small industrial yards on a hull. The smallest are two-person skiffs making quick-grab runs along the Shear's accessible edges. Ratter speech calls all of these vessels **skiffs**, from the two-person craft to the twelve-person yard ship.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Claims and Remote Cuts"
    A working Ratter keeps a claim ledger, cutter inspection records, cargo grades, rescue coverage, and the chain of brokers who will take the haul. Long-rats distinguish the forms required for flight and sale from the extra records demanded in a claim dispute. A clean ledger gives a crew room to refuse a bad buyer because the next one can verify its work.

    Ratters developed #{encyclopedia_ref :claim_coupling, "Claim Coupling"} for Deep Shear claims that could not be boarded safely. An expendable cutter works the seam while the crew operates a #{encyclopedia_ref :pell_skiff, "Pell Skiff"} at stand-off range. The cutter can be lost. A process room can be sealed and replaced. The crew has a route home.

    The work produced its own boards and brokers. The #{ref :pell_freight_assembly, "Pell Freight Assembly"} finances shared receiving yards and hauler access for member crews while claims remain with the crews that worked them. Some flotillas join the Assembly; others sell through its yards one haul at a time.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :geography, heading: "Ports"
    Ratter ports occupy the Shear's accessible edges and near-orbital periphery. Some are patchwork stations built around mining anchors on stable debris masses. Others occupy half-ruined habs whose lower-deck systems remain active under negotiated boundaries with the residents above. The smallest consist of a docking ring, repair berth, stores, and a fence's counting room around an outcropping of fused ringglass.

    Each station governs itself, often under a retired long-rat or former captain. The waystations trade with one another through Ratter traffic and reach the larger system through nearby surface settlements. #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"}'s dock fringe is the most common public-facing port for Ratter business; the Compact's office is uptown, and Ratter deals stay downhill from it.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "Identity"
    Ratter crews recognize standing through gear, cant, and marks used together.

    **The gear.** Coats, harnesses, and ship interiors are working patchworks of salvaged ringglass scraps, repurposed ring-era components, and hand-stitched repairs. Each piece on a coat records material recovered, a port visited, or a repair made by another crew. New gear is plain; years of work add visible layers.

    **The cant.** Shear-cant supplies specific terms for debris types, weather conditions, hazards, claim states, ship problems, and people. The vocabulary and its vacuum-work hand signs have entered surface speech in salvage towns. Fluency is tested in use: false route terms or a hand sign given in the wrong work order identify a speaker whose claim to Shear experience needs checking.

    **The marks.** Working Ratters carry two visible markers. The first is a **crew tattoo** of their current ship's mark, usually on the wrist, neck, or back of a hand. Someone who changes ships acquires a new tattoo and keeps the old ones; a senior captain's forearms can be a history of the crews they have served. The second is a **shard pendant** of ringglass from the bearer's first claim — the first piece of salvage they personally recovered and held as their own. The shard is worn at the throat or wrist. Crews issue it once. A missing shard marks a new worker or a loss whose history the wearer may be asked to give.

    Gear, cant, and marks form the working credential together. A crew checks all three before sharing a current chart, taking on a partner, or accepting a claimed rescue debt.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    Tens of thousands of Ratters work the Shear. Compact attempts to count them have produced no stable total across moving crews and independent ports. They remain the working majority in the Shear and the model for independent salvage elsewhere in the system. Their ships range from immaculate to layers of temporary repair, and their margins remain thin after #{elapsed 2320, approx: true} of refusing consolidation.

    Apprentices learn on a working skiff: cant and hand signs during the job, claim ledgers after it, route memory on watch, and the debt and distress calls through the flotilla channel. A first claim adds the shard pendant; a first ship adds the crew mark. Changing ships adds another mark without erasing the earlier service.
  PROSE

  affordance "A current chart, verified work history, or introduction from a long-rat opens routes, buyers, repair berths, and crews that remain closed to an unknown salvager."
  pressure "Current charts, broker introductions, and work histories travel crew to crew; when a ledger or mark is disputed, captains compare copies before extending the same standing at the next port."
  cue "Ratters read a newcomer through the patchwork coat, Shear-cant, and the shard pendant from a first claim; a crew checks all three before sharing a current chart."
  cue "At shift's end, several independent skiff crews crowd one chart table, adding hazards and buyer marks to shared copies before each captain carries a separate ledger back aboard."
  variation "Flotillas range from four skiffs under a first-season long-rat to the old formations whose charts go back generations; the long-rat's authority is identical in kind at both scales and different in weight."
  variation "Anchor stations organize standing through build-debt, divided habs through boundary agreements, and small docking rings through the fence's ledger; a traveled Ratter adjusts manners at the airlock."
