  prose <<~PROSE
    The Red Sovereign places collective subjects under standing command. The same voice can order a city to open, a fleet to turn its weapons, an army to kneel, or a machine intelligence to betray the purpose around which it was built. Each person or machine receives the order in terms they understand and repeats the decisive words before obeying.

    Living subjects experience the command as their own decision arriving with impossible certainty. Machines preserve it as an unauthorized root instruction, sometimes beyond an ordinary reset. Resistance exposes the command's cost: a recent detail may vanish during one immediate struggle, while prolonged control can remove the event that made a friendship, loyalty, or grievance matter to the bearer.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Aren Talivar"
    #{ref :aren_talivar, "Aren Talivar"} has borne the mantle since 2435. #{ref :detha, "Detha"}'s freely given obedience qualified him; her later resistance and escape did not transfer it. He now holds #{ref :velisar, "Velisar"} and seeks permanent command of the Istravan coast.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :language, heading: "The Subject's Words"
    Dominion follows the subject's understanding. An order to fly a vessel gives no piloting skill. A machine told to identify a liar can act only if it already has a method for that judgment. Undefined terms resolve according to the listener's knowledge, not the speaker's private intent. People contest a command by exposing an impossible action, separating connected machinery, or forcing two subject groups to state the same word differently.

    Complex orders can stand for seasons, but every term then acquires the history of those living under it. A city told to keep a gate secure may obey through closure, inspection, expulsion, or destruction according to which authority the command recognizes. The sovereign can issue a clarification; it must overcome resistance again and may leave the earlier command active where the new words were never received.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :legacy, heading: "The Red Crown"
    Tessellan shadow lists call this mantle *Red Sovereign*. Its red is Will imposed from outside another person's Form, and several copies replace the written title with a blank red crown. The title names the office created by the second voice: wherever the command is heard, the bearer becomes the authority the mantle recognizes.

    Memory pays for that authority. A command to surrender a weapon may take the bearer's memory of acquiring one. An order that makes soldiers abandon their families may erase the face of the bearer's closest kin while leaving the bare fact of the relationship. #{encyclopedia_ref :binding, "Binding"} can preserve the lost event's words and hesitations but cannot restore why they mattered to the bearer.

    Absolute disobedience opens succession. A subject must understand the command, resist it, and reach the bearer while the mantle is still enforcing the words. The red second voice then moves into them. The former sovereign remembers having ruled and may no longer remember why anyone feared them.

  gm_note :complicates, "A subject who knowingly disobeys an absolute command and reaches the bearer becomes the possible successor, even while the same command continues through every person and machine that accepted it."
