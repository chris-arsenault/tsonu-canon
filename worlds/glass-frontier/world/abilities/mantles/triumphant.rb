  log "2026-09-15 — Veska Ral is the most recently attested bearer in the Istravan record, qualified in 2414 and killed by the cost of the completed 2418 evacuation. No present successor is assigned."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The Triumphant draws a willing company, vessel, army, fleet, or city into one declared purpose. A routed defense can stand, a crippled fleet can complete a maneuver, or a city can lift fallen structures and carry its wounded while a disaster advances. Every participant receives only the strength, precision, or endurance that serves the shared words.

    The bearer speaks at ordinary volume and the declaration answers from every participating voice, engine, and weapon. Heat brightens along veins and seams; movement loses waste; warning gauges hold at their stops. The mantle sharpens judgment and capacity already present. An untrained hand remains unable to fly, and an empty weapon remains empty.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "Veska Ral"
    #{ref :veska_ral, "Veska Ral"} qualified in 2414 through a finite public convoy rescue and survived its cost. She died after completing the #{ref :velisar_evacuation, "Velisar evacuation"} in 2418, when its accumulated injuries entered her. The Istravan record names no later bearer.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :language, heading: "Words With an End"
    A declaration must name an act that can finish. *Survive* supplies no end. *Keep the eastern docks open until the last evacuation kite clears* can hold thousands of people and machines. Living subjects must understand the words; machines must be able to embody them as physical work. Witnesses repeat the declaration before large workings so its boundaries are public.

    Different meanings divide the rhythm. If one crew hears *hold the dock* as defending it and another hears it as keeping traffic moving, each receives only the effort that serves its own purpose. A subject who knowingly abandons the declaration leaves the cadence immediately. The bearer can narrow or replace the words, but the old purpose ends and releases everything it deferred.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aftermath, heading: "When the Rhythm Stops"
    Heat, fatigue, blood loss, cracked housings, impact trauma, and strained joints accumulate throughout the working. When the purpose is fulfilled, made impossible, abandoned, or replaced, the mantle gathers that deferred damage into the bearer at once. The subjects and machines remain where the exalted effort carried them; the bearer receives the cost that allowed them to arrive.

    Tessellan copies place the title at the red Triangulum. In their usage, *Triumphant* names a purpose raised above competing limits, not the outcome of the struggle. The same public wording governs succession. If the bearer knowingly abandons the declaration and another person continues it unchanged, the shared cadence can turn to the second voice and carry the mantle with it.
