  prose <<~PROSE
    The Great Restorer gathers scattered patterns into one composite return. With enough witnesses, the bearer can call a shattered vessel from its debris, recover an archive from readers and burned substrate, or return a district from its foundations, records, tools, and surviving inhabitants. The mantle makes that assembled state authoritative over the later damage.

    Every return has a source. Fragments carry shape and material; living bodies carry scars, nerve paths, and remembered motion; archives survive through copies, checks, impressions, and people who learned their contents. Restorers lay out those witnesses before large work because their agreement determines the state that comes back. A confident account with no surviving pattern contributes nothing to the working.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Eris Talven"
    #{ref :eris_talven, "Eris Talven"} is the present bearer. His predecessor completed the #{ref :ruvian_return, "return of Ruvian"} in 2429 and disclosed its missing bow gallery and her lost depth perception before the mantle passed. Eris now prepares a return at #{ref :ithara, "Ithara"}.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Competing Returns"
    Large subjects often preserve more than one complete state. Two archives may hold incompatible final copies. A population may remember two borders, each carried by roads, records, and homes. A vessel's emergency reconstruction can be newer and less complete than its original body. The mantle can make one state physical. People contest a proposed restoration by producing another surviving witness and showing what the chosen return would remove.

    The chosen state brings back everything that belonged to it. A restored city receives cracked conduits, concealed rooms, unpaid obligations, illnesses, and malicious instructions present on that day. Qualification requires the restorer to name those contents before the working. Tessellan copies call the mantle *Great* for a composite return assembled from many witnesses, not for the worth of the state restored.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :legacy, heading: "The Preserved Loss"
    In every composite return, one part of the loss remains unrecovered so the restored state can close as one coherent subject. The bearer names it before the working. The absence then enters them as a missing face, a silent hand, an erased interval, a lost skill, or a wound shaped like the street that did not return.

    Succession follows disclosure rather than death or defeat. After completing a restoration, the bearer must give the restored people a full account of what returned, what old flaws came with it, and what loss they chose to preserve. The mantle can pass only through a working whose unavoidable omission the bearer refused to hide.

  gm_note :complicates, "A restoration returns old flaws, hidden rooms, infections, obligations, and hostile instructions that belonged to the chosen state, while every contradictory complete state becomes part of the named loss."
