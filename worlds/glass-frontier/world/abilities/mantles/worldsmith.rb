  prose <<~PROSE
    The Worldsmith extends #{encyclopedia_ref :shaping, "Shaping"} across a connected mass. The bearer can take hold of a wreck, mountain face, vessel, or broken district and make it answer as one structure. Towers rise from fallen plate; a shattered ring section receives a new load path while people remain inside it. Shaping's material law remains: matter stays present, living tissue resists, and every change follows the model in the bearer's hands.

    Matter stays cold and solid during the change. Mass, grain, alloy boundaries, repairs, and old damage remain present, so a finished wall may carry curved welds and a former deck may climb through it as a dark band. This continuity distinguishes Worldsmith work from replacement or concealment. Surveyors can follow the earlier structure through the new one, and courts can still identify a disputed repair.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Reading the Load"
    Worldsmith work begins before the bearer touches the material. Joints are exposed, live conduits marked, cavities sounded, and moving loads counted. A bearer may use a #{encyclopedia_ref :load_singing, "singer's"} chalk map on a wreck or walk a hab span beside someone trained in #{encyclopedia_ref :load_listening, "load listening"}. The mantle supplies force and reach; those records, instruments, and working hands supply much of the model that directs it.

    Work on an occupied structure is conducted in stages. The bearer changes one load path, waits for the mass and its occupants to settle, then reads the next. A rushed change can make a perfectly shaped district around an omitted cistern, a moving crowd, or a live machine. People contest a proposed working by contesting the model: they mark an uncounted void, demand another sounding, or refuse to clear the bearing surface until their load appears on the plan.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :limits, heading: "The Map in the Bones"
    In a great working, each omission enters both structure and bearer. A hidden chamber becomes a void in the new load path. An unrecognized alloy tears away from its neighbors. A moving population treated as static weight can bring down the structure meant to save it. The corresponding error appears in the bearer's body as hairline fractures, a misjoined vertebra, or mineral growth along the line of the bad assumption. Further shaping can brace the injury but cannot remove it.

    Surviving mantle accounts recognize a successor by one qualification: the candidate has misunderstood a real structure, repaired the failure that followed, and can still name the wrong model. The mantle passes when its bearer dies or freely yields it to such a person. Tessellan copies place the mantle beside the gold Tetrahedron; ordinary practitioners remain shapers, and *Worldsmith* is reserved for the designation.

  gm_note :triggered_by, "When the bearer reshapes anything under live load, every unmarked void, mixed material, moving machine, or person becomes part of the result; an omitted load appears as both a structural flaw and a matching injury."
  gm_note :complicates, "Worldsmith work preserves every seam, patch, and fracture in its new geometry, so an old repair, concealed compartment, or disputed act of sabotage remains legible after the structure has changed beyond recognition."
