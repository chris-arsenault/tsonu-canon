  prose <<~PROSE
    The Bitter Reach was the system-wide conflict from 2407 to 2423. It grew from disputes that the #{ref :bloom_coalition, "Bloom Coalition"} had held inside a common forum and that its dissolution left to separate factions. Former partners entered the new fighting with shared routes, recent grievances, and direct knowledge of one another's supply limits.

    No declaration opened the war. Convoys began refusing rival ports, patrols held junctions beyond their home authority, and lenders in Sithari restricted credit to settlements supporting the opposing side. By the time armed ships exchanged fire at three route stations in 2407, the same factions had already been fighting through contracts and cargo holds for years.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :course, heading: "Routes and Embargoes"
    Most fighting followed #{ref :keel, "the Keel"} and the approaches joining surface ports to ring habitats. Third Arc Defense escorted pressure cargo and civilian signals through embargo zones. Vantara protected its stations and contracted convoys, then charged for access to routes its opponents considered common infrastructure. Continuity ministries supplied favored factions while Sithari remained formally open under city law.

    Occupations were usually brief because a route station could be held more easily than supplied. The earlier #{ref :hinge_six_occupation, "Hinge Six occupation"} in 2362 remained the best-known warning: Third Arc Defense had seized the relay to filter embargo traffic, and the station's keepers shut it down. Similar refusals by dispatchers, repair crews, and receiving ports kept local victories from becoming durable control.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :course, heading: "The Istravan Coast"
    The #{ref :istravan_league, "Istravan League"} defended approaches on Korvath's warm middle sea. The #{ref :velisar_evacuation, "evacuation of Velisar"} in 2418 carried threatened households to refuges including Sereva on Ashvane. Veska Ral held the embarkation ground while Aren Talivar organized departures.

    The league demobilized under Sava Neraleth in 2423. Those returned forces and surviving refuge commitments became part of the coast's peace; Aren's later seizure of Velisar belongs to a new conflict in 2435.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :limits, heading: "The Neutral Cordons"
    The #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"} kept Bloom cordons outside the war. It denied staging access to every faction, including forces carrying medicine or claiming pursuit. Gray Line closed its gates on Continuity, Vantara, and Third Arc convoys in turn.

    The rule preserved a shared containment service while other institutions divided. It also made the Council one of the few bodies whose records and personnel remained acceptable to all sides when mediation resumed.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aftermath, heading: "The Settlement of 2423"
    By 2423 no faction could secure the routes it needed without agreements with former opponents. Member governments transferred convoy guarantees, docking recognition, and dispute records into the new #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"}. Third Arc Defense dissolved; Vantara accepted common mediation for route claims; Sithari placed the Accord offices outside the Continuity's executive grounds.

    The fighting stopped through linked settlements rather than one surrender. Some embargo claims and losses remain unresolved. Accord panels still encounter contracts whose parties date their obligations from different closures during the war.
  PROSE

  gm_note :appears, "Any contract, debt or docking right written before 2423 carries a start date its two parties disagree about, because the war closed in separate settlements rather than one surrender. Hearings on old paper open with an argument over which closure governs."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Name a settlement in the wrong port and someone there can list which convoys it turned away and whose credit Sithari cut on its account. Embargo losses were never settled, and the people who ate them still work the same routes."
  gm_note :complicates, "Route crews learned during the war that a seized station can be closed by its own keepers, and dispatchers, repair crews and receiving ports still reach for refusal before resistance. Taking a junction by force wins a junction with nothing moving through it."
