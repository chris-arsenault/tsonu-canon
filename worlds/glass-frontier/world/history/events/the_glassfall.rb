  prose <<~PROSE
    In 2140 CE, the orbital rings broke.

    It wasn't gradual. It wasn't a slow decline that people saw coming and argued about until it was too late. One day the rings were there — the same crystalline halo that had encircled Kaleidos since before anyone alive could remember — and then they weren't. The cascading failure took hours, not days. By nightfall, the sky was full of falling glass.

    The ring didn't vanish. It broke apart — enormous sections cracking free and drifting into new orbits, trailing debris. Many contained self-sustaining inhabited environments and survived intact enough to keep their populations alive. But the connections between them severed. The integrated system became isolated sections whose habs had to rely on the services still working within reach.

    On the surface of Kaleidos, the damage was different. Debris rained down as showers of crystal fragments and dust — dangerous, but not extinction-level. The real destruction was systemic. The rings had been the backbone of the colony's infrastructure: power distribution, climate regulation, communication, orbital logistics. All of it, gone.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :cause, heading: "The Cause"
    Nobody knows. Not with certainty.

    The prevailing theory is sabotage — some kind of internal attack that triggered a structural cascade. The evidence for this is mostly negative: the rings were engineered to survive natural stresses far beyond anything Kaleidos's orbit could produce. Something deliberate had to have initiated the failure.

    Who did it, and why, is the subject of #{elapsed :the_glassfall, approx: true} of speculation, investigation, and increasingly entrenched disagreement. The #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"} maintains classified archives from the ring-era custodian AIs that might contain answers. Whether they've found anything and aren't sharing, or genuinely don't know, is itself a source of tension.

    Most people have stopped expecting an answer. The Glassfall is history now — the kind that shapes everything but that nobody alive experienced firsthand. It matters the way an earthquake matters: not as a mystery to solve, but as the reason the landscape looks the way it does.

    The ring did not vanish — it shattered. Enormous sections cracked free and drifted into new orbits, and what had been one continuous structure became the #{ref :the_glass_frontier, "Glass Frontier"}: surviving habs, a growing debris field, and the raw material for most resonance technology. The integrated machine was destroyed; its inhabited sections continued beside planetary and lunar communities.

    Communication infrastructure collapsed, leaving surface settlements and ring habitats in #{elapsed :the_glassfall, :the_rekindling} of fragmented survival: the Signal Famine. Communities that had belonged to one connected civilization developed separate laws, practices, and repair traditions. When sustained contact returned, those differences had to be negotiated rather than erased; the #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"} now carries part of that work.

    The same break that scattered the habs filled the orbital lanes with wreckage. Trailing debris from the cracking ring settled into a turbulent, resonance-distorted band between atmosphere and orbit — the #{ref :the_shear, "Shear"} — which has been the system's most dangerous and most lucrative salvage ground ever since.

    When the ring broke, its #{encyclopedia_ref :ringglass, "ringglass"} rained across Kaleidos and settled into the planet's crust and waterways, still holding the faint imprint of the transmissions it had once carried.
