  prose <<~PROSE
    The food shortage that turned the first restored signal between #{ref :hab_meridian, "Hab Meridian"} and #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"} into a working freight relationship. Meridian expanded its old growing beds after Reconnection traffic increased. The new beds used the same preserved root culture as the old ones. A blight that one varied field could have contained crossed nearly the whole hab.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :course, heading: "Living Cargo"
    Glasswake could supply seed, live soil cultures, and enough varied root stock to restart the beds. Meridian could pay in tuned orbital components, but neither community had rules for moving a warm biological cargo from surface to orbit. Ordinary freight manifests described mass and value. They did not record temperature, air exchange, or which containers could be opened together.

    Growers travelled with the cargo. Meridian technicians came down on the return legs to fit ringglass controls in Glasswake's workshops. Each shipment carried a shared manifest signed by the people who packed it and the people prepared to receive it.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aftermath, heading: "The Repeating Run"
    Meridian lost a harvest but not the growing beds. Glasswake gained a regular market for living cargo and a dependable source of tuned components. The temporary schedule continued after the shortage ended.

    Later carriers adopted the receiving signatures, environmental limits, and named-custodian fields from the crop manifests. The forms changed. The principle that a cargo record must describe what keeps its contents alive did not.

  gm_note :appears, "Cargo records for anything alive still carry the fields the crop runs invented: environmental limits, a named custodian, and signatures from the people who packed the load and the people ready to receive it. The shortage reaches a freight scene as paperwork."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Meridian growers object to any bed expanded on a single proven culture, and will say why: identical closed-cycle beds are what let one root blight cross nearly the whole hab in 2317."
  gm_note :complicates, "Living cargo on the #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"} run travels with its growers, so a shipment that would otherwise be a hold and a manifest becomes a passenger problem, with the people who packed the cultures aboard to hand them to whoever signs."
