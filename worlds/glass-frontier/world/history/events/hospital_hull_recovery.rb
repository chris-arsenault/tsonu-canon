  prose <<~PROSE
    Brake captured a medical vessel with warm surgical rooms, stocked pharmacies, and twelve occupied recovery capsules. The patients carry stable vital signs and synchronized sleep cycles. Its navigation record ends during the Bitter Reach, while wear on the outer hull records many years of later travel.

    The vessel remains beside Forty on independent power, water, and clinical monitoring. Ira Voss is tracing the patient records through sealed cabinets. Five Bolts holds the hull clear of every inhabited anchor and maintains the only tow line approved for an emergency separation.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Custody and Care"
    Brake treats the patients as living arrivals rather than salvage. Intake workers have suspended every ownership claim on the vessel and issue medicine from its pharmacy only to its own clinical systems. The recovery capsules can be opened from the surgical room, but the surviving instructions begin with a patient history absent from the cabinets Voss has cleared.

    Cutter crews want access to the drive record and sealed machinery behind the clinical deck. Ward representatives want the vessel joined to Brake before its stores fail. The medical watch keeps both requests behind the patient marks on Voss's intake board.

  gm_note :appears, "Work at Brake that touches salvage or ward business draws a request to carry someone's case past the medical watch: cutter crews want the drive record behind the clinical deck, and ward representatives want the hull joined to the settlement before its stores fail."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Talk of waking one of the twelve meets the first line of the capsule instructions, which calls for a patient history absent from every cabinet #{ref :ira_voss, "Voss"} has cleared. The surgical room will open a capsule without it."
  gm_note :complicates, "An alarm anywhere in the yard puts the vessel on one decision: #{ref :five_bolts, "Five Bolts"} holds the only tow line approved for emergency separation, and cutting the hull loose takes twelve sleeping patients away from Brake's power, water, and monitoring."
