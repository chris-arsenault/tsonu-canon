  prose <<~PROSE
    Shardfall was a four-day salvage battle beside #{ref :brake, "Brake"} in 2348. #{ref :drossmark_industries, "Drossmark Industries"}, the #{ref :brake_free_cutters, "Brake Free Cutters"}, and #{ref :split_wake, "Split Wake"} fought over an intact-grade ringglass field close to the hab's capture lanes. Linked extraction arrays carried the field's resonance into Brake and killed forty-seven people, including eleven residents inside the hab.

    Brake's observation galleries, claim channel, and arrestor instruments recorded the battle. Copies travelled with departing carriers. Shardfall became the evidence cited whenever an operator claimed that a private salvage risk ended at the edge of its own vessel.

    Two debris masses ground past each other and exposed intact-grade material inside the field. The Brake Free Cutters placed claim buoys, made assay cuts, and notified the hab before moving their transfer barges into position.

    Drossmark arrived with three heavy arrays and rejected the local claim. Its crews fixed the exposed mass, the neighboring debris, and their carrier into one cutting field. Brake's arrestor instruments began answering the extraction tone before the first full load left the rigs. The hab ordered both parties to stop work. The Cutters powered down. Drossmark continued cutting while contesting Brake's authority over open Shear.

    Split Wake approached during the standoff. Its target was the ringglass already loaded into Cutters' barges and Drossmark skiffs, not the raw field.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :course, heading: "Course"
    Split Wake fired on a Drossmark transfer skiff. Drossmark escorts returned fire across the Cutters' marked work line. The Cutters moved their barges toward Brake and fired when an escort tried to hold one in the field. The three groups fought among active arrays, tethered debris, and damaged vessels while Brake kept the claim channel open.

    On the fourth day, the linked arrays settled onto the same structural response as Brake's kinetic arrestors. The extraction tone crossed the field into the hab. One capture frame snapped inward, pressure doors closed through occupied corridors, and an observation gallery lost its outer wall. Local crews cut the arrestor feeds and the Cutters severed the nearest array tether. The response stopped after it had crossed three inhabited wards.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aftermath, heading: "Aftermath"
    Brake's final ledger records forty-seven dead: eighteen Drossmark workers, nine Free Cutters, nine members of Split Wake, and eleven hab residents. Rescue crews recovered everyone whose route into the field remained on an isolated clock. The others were identified from suit records, drive logs, and the observation gallery roll.

    Brake expelled Drossmark and held the surviving Split Wake crews. The Free Cutters stabilized the field through single-vessel cuts and completed extraction in 2351. The last load paid for pressure repairs, household shares for the dead, and permanent rescue stores at the capture lanes.

    Ports began refusing Drossmark cargo within days of receiving Brake's recordings. Proposals for common Shear rules cited the open claim channel, the arrestor traces, and Drossmark's linked controls. Those records later became part of the founding case for the #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"}.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :legacy, heading: "Legacy"
    "Another Shardfall" means a salvage risk has crossed into someone else's air, route, or structure. Compact inspectors use the phrase when an operator treats a linked field as separate machines. Brake uses the event's drive sequence in claim hearings because it fixes who moved, who fired, and which arrays remained active.

    Forty-seven cut marks remain along the replacement rail of Brake's observation gallery. The two unpowered Drossmark frames in the cutting yards are used as sorting tables. Split Wake's ships were dismantled there. The field itself is empty of intact-grade material and carries ordinary local traffic.
