  prose <<~PROSE
    The current sarn passage divided at Perch. One herd crossed the far fragment along the recorded route. The second entered a widening circle around the settlement and began shedding combs at every turn.

    The circling animals remain strong and feed from carried fat. Their fallen combs hold a structural map of Perch's inhabited decks, including temporary wards erected after the herd arrived. The old animals occupy the quiet center while younger adults carry the strained outer edge.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Closed Water"
    Pava Lorn closed the inner collection band and recalled every line that crossed the circle. Ferries now approach through the far fragment, adding a full shift to each passenger and provision run. Seasonal wards have begun pooling food while the permanent kitchens ration water stored for the closing market.

    Molt follows the oldest animals through the center with empty comb racks and observation frames. The vessel has recovered two exhausted juveniles whose flight combs carry the same new map as the shed material.

  gm_note :appears, "Every ferry now reaches Perch around the far fragment for a full extra shift, so an errand that used to take a morning arrives late and any delivery promised against the old crossing time is already broken."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Put a fallen comb in front of anyone who can read structure and the map inside covers wards raised after the herd arrived; combs shed on later turns show decks that were not standing when the earlier ones fell."
  gm_note :complicates, "The permanent kitchens are rationing water laid in for the closing market and the seasonal wards have started pooling food, so a party asking Perch for supplies, berths, or hired hands is bidding against several thousand stalled workers."
