  prose <<~PROSE
    A freight crew crossed a dry basin on Kaleidos in 2235 with a kinetic array fixed to three cloth spars. The surviving maintenance record includes the first tuning another workshop could reproduce without the original crew or machine present.

    Surface workshops copied the arrangement within the year. Later engines changed their arrays, hulls, and controls, but retained the sail surfaces that carried the first stable structural support.
  PROSE

  gm_note :appears, "Any argument about who owns an early kite design eventually reaches the surviving maintenance record, whose copies differ in the marks attributed to the freight crew."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Comparing an early copy with a modern engine exposes which changes were repairs, which became standards, and which workshop later claimed as inventions."
  gm_note :complicates, "The record proves repeatability, not the identity of the person who found the tuning, leaving every later ownership claim attached to an anonymous working crew."
