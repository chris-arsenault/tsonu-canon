  prose <<~PROSE
    Six cargo pods entered Clearance Eight's capture field from the same empty trajectory. Each contained repaired household objects packed in fresh restraint cloth. An Eighth Seal was fixed inside every lid, carrying current impressions from all eight desks in their proper order.

    The named claimants live at Clearance Eight and remember losing the objects during separate recent journeys. None had filed for repair. The route desk placed the pods together in a powered custody row while Tangent followed their approach line beyond the cleared lane.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Claims Held Open"
    The ownership desk can return each object to its claimant. The identity and route desks refuse to close the cases while the fresh seals remain unexplained. Every additional day of custody adds storage debt to people who neither requested the repair nor chose the return route.

    Tangent carries an empty cradle and a reader loaded with the six seal sequences. Its patrol follows the pods' approach into a branch recorded as clear space on the current lane chart.

  gm_note :appears, "The six claimants live at #{ref :clearance_eight} and lost the objects on separate recent journeys, so any character who has misplaced gear on a run can be called into a claim room to identify a repaired version of it."
  gm_note :complicates, "Every day the identity and route desks hold the cases open adds storage debt to claimants who never asked for the repair, so the people pressing hardest for a disposition are residents watching a bill grow against something they already own."
