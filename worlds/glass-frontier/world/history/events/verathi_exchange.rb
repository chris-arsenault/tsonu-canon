  prose <<~PROSE
    The first Reconnection dispute between two communities that both wanted contact. #{ref :verathi, "Verathi"} answered surface signals, exchanged records freely, and accepted a visiting delegation. The disagreement began when Sithari's restoration commission presented credentials that treated the hab as a returning district of the old ring administration.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :course, heading: "Two Sets of Credentials"
    Verathi's receivers recognized the commission and cleared its vessel to dock. Its civic chambers then received the visitors as representatives of a foreign government. The commission carried authority to restore services and appoint a district liaison. Verathi had maintained its own registry, courts, and life-support councils throughout the Signal Famine and offered to exchange ambassadors.

    Both parties kept talking. Cargo moved through the dock while the documents were rewritten. The commission removed every clause that assumed inherited jurisdiction. Verathi replaced its offer of hospitality with a reciprocal mission whose staff would hold the same protections in Sithari that Sitharian staff held aboard the hab.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aftermath, heading: "The Exchange"
    The signed instruments established missions in both communities and recognized each one's records within the other. Later contacts copied the useful parts: identify the body that can bind the community, state whose law applies aboard a visiting vessel, and make every privilege reciprocal.

    Verathi joined the wider system without rejoining the government that had preceded the Glassfall. The distinction shaped every successful contact that followed.
