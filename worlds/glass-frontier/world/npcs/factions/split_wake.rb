  prose <<~PROSE
    Split Wake was a mobile pirate crew of three armed cutters and a fast loader during the Contested Reach. Its ships approached on diverging thrust lines, crossed a convoy's wake, and struck the vessel that turned toward either threat. Pilots named the pattern first; the crews adopted it.

    The group stole refined loads and abandoned raw fields. At #{ref :shardfall, "Shardfall"}, intact-grade ringglass already sat in the local miners' transfer barges while corporate rigs filled more. Split Wake entered for the loaded material and fired on a transfer skiff drawing away from the field.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aftermath, heading: "Broken at Shardfall"
    The return fire trapped Split Wake between the linked arrays and the route home. Two cutters were destroyed during the battle. The loader lost pressure in the cascade, and its surviving crew surrendered at the hab's outer lock. The last cutter surrendered after its weapons mount failed.

    Split Wake did not operate again. Nine members died and fourteen entered Brake custody. The surviving ships were cut apart after the casualty hearings; their drive records supplied the sequence used in every later account of the battle.

  gm_note :appears, "The name is a maneuver before it is a crew: two thrust lines diverging across a convoy's wake, striking whichever ship turns to meet one of them. Shear convoy pilots still call the pattern out by name when they see it forming behind them."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Any claim about the sequence of the #{ref :shardfall, "Shardfall"} battle can be checked against Split Wake's drive records, pulled before the ships were cut apart after the casualty hearings and used in every account written since."
  gm_note :complicates, "Split Wake went for refined loads and ignored raw fields, so its victims were whoever had already done the work. At Shardfall that meant the local miners' transfer barges and a skiff drawing away from the field, not the corporate rigs still cutting."
