  prose <<~PROSE
    A defense and logistics pact formed by three outer ring habs during the Contested Reach. Each member supplied patrol craft, dispatchers, and stores; command rotated between their delegations. The pact escorted food and pressure cargo through contested lanes and treated civilian relays as common infrastructure.

    Third Arc Defense became known beyond its members after occupying #{ref :hinge_six, "Hinge Six"} and filtering embargo traffic through the station. Its own keepers shut the relay rather than let the occupation continue. The pact survived that defeat as a convoy organization, fought through the Bitter Reach, and dissolved when its remaining members transferred route guarantees into the Tempered Accord.
