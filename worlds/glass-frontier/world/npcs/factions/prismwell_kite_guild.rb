    ideology:
      "Shower knowledge is pooled property: every hazard reading enters " \
      "the shared record before the collected dust reaches market, " \
      "costing a successful crew some advantage so that no crew enters a " \
      "front blind. The guild belongs to its working wells, not to any " \
      "office above them.",
    methods:
      "Scouts fly ahead of a predicted stream with reinforced leading " \
      "edges and several independent instruments, dropping marker lights " \
      "where the safest crossing is likely to hold; collection kites " \
      "follow into the thin trailing edge with sacrificial cloth " \
      "unfolded between short spars. Withholding a hazard reading ends a " \
      "crew's access to every Prismwell well.",
    presence:
      "Craft known by pale catch panels folded against the hull between " \
      "showers, and yards of collection cloth, sorting floors, and " \
      "repair benches around stepped wells that throw fractured light " \
      "after a fall. Working cloth comes back grey and stiff with fused " \
      "grains — crews object when visitors mistake clean display cloth " \
      "for it.",
    attitude:
      "Independents may fly on the published forecasts without joining; " \
      "they pay more for repair, take no share of the collection, and " \
      "still become a Prismwell rescue job when a front closes behind " \
      "them. The guild honors its trade with the groves below — narrowed " \
      "catches for ground readings — while disputing every season how " \
      "much crystal the vegetation actually needs."

  prose <<~PROSE
    A pilots' guild, repair network, and regional carrier based at #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"}. The Prismwell Kite Guild specializes in routes affected by #{encyclopedia_ref :glassfall_showers, "Glassfall showers"}: predicting the streams, carrying traffic around dense fronts, and recovering clean ringglass grains from the fall. Its craft are recognized by pale catch panels folded against the hull between showers.

    The name comes from Glasswake's first collection yards. Miners dug stepped wells into the sheltered side of the fallen ring fragment and lined them with dark cloth. After a shower, sorted crystal at the bottom threw fractured light up the walls. The wells became workshops, the workshops pooled their pilots, and the pilots formed the guild in 2312 as traffic through the newly reopened routes increased.

    Guild scouts fly ahead of a predicted stream with reinforced leading edges and several independent field instruments. They track larger fragments, record how the ambient gradient moves, and release simple marker lights where the safest crossing is likely to hold. Later craft receive the measurements directly and still carry their own observers. Fine debris can divide around a mass the scout never saw or close a route between one vessel and the next.

    Collection flights enter the thin trailing edge. Their kites unfold sacrificial cloth between short spars, gathering dust without presenting a rigid surface to larger impacts. The cloth returns grey and stiff with fused grains. Glasswake crews wash it over tiered basins, then sound each fraction with broad reference tones. Instrument-grade crystal is uncommon. Mixed fines go into structural aggregate, filters, and low-output household glass.

    The guild maintains ordinary passenger and freight service between these flights. Its shower knowledge makes it useful across the surface-access spurs of #{ref :keel, "the Keel"}, where a delayed front can strand descending vessels between safe fields.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Pilots and Wells"
    Prismwell is owned by its working wells. Each yard holds collection cloth, sorting floors, repair benches, and a roster of craft. A yard may specialize in surface falls, high-atmosphere capture, or orbital crossings. Pilots take work through the yard and contribute part of each payment to shared repairs and forecasts.

    Route observations circulate across the guild before the cleaned dust reaches market. This arrangement costs a successful crew some advantage and keeps another crew from entering a front blind. Withholding a hazard reading can end access to every Prismwell well. Arguments over the grade or ownership of recovered crystal remain local to the yards and are frequent.

    Independent pilots use the published forecasts without joining. They pay more for repair and receive no share of collected material. The guild accepts this because more eyes on a shower improve the record and because a stranded independent still becomes a Prismwell rescue job.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "The Groves Below"
    Some surface shower paths cross the #{ref :miraeth, "Miraeth"} basins protected by the #{ref :lumenshard_conservatory, "Lumenshard Conservatory"}. Prismwell crews once spread broad catch cloth above those basins and removed most of a season's fresh ringglass before it reached the vegetation. The groves' local fields weakened over the following years, and living crystal growth failed along the collection line.

    Guild flights now narrow their catches above known groves and leave the dense lower fall alone. The Conservatory provides ground readings that improve the shower forecasts in return. Neither side agrees on how much crystal a grove requires or how much a moving stream would have deposited without collection. A thin season brings the argument back immediately.

    Glassfall traffic has shifted toward the mid-drift as several familiar streams spread into new fronts. Prismwell is extending orbital repair capacity and hiring pilots accustomed to the Shear. The work pays well because the same fine debris that fills a catch cloth can strip an exposed control surface in minutes.

    The guild's Glasswake wells remain its center. Tourists visit the oldest stepped basin for the light. Working crews use the deeper wells beyond it and object when visitors mistake the clean display cloth for equipment that has crossed a shower.
