    ideology:
      "A grove is one working ecology — food plants, water filters, " \
      "roots, insects, fungi, and ringglass all pulling on the same field " \
      "— and resonance damage can heal so long as matter keeps its stable " \
      "relationships. Miraeth is the standing proof of that conviction, " \
      "and the late entry into the Bloom Coalition is its standing cost.",
    methods:
      "Workers read a grove from its edges inward: young leaves show " \
      "sharp changes first, roots answer through shallow stakes, and " \
      "outflow water carries traces of every crystal surface it crossed. " \
      "Use alternates with rest — sections go electrically and resonantly " \
      "quiet after a dense shower or a long draw — and strange reports " \
      "are answered by planting quick-rooting beds and watching where the " \
      "roots stop behaving as connected matter.",
    presence:
      "Growers, field ecologists, and resonance workers moving through " \
      "groves that shine along their veins at dusk, carrying substrate " \
      "maps and seed stock rather than fixed instruments. Builders come " \
      "to them for living crystal grafts, cut roots and branches that go " \
      "on adjusting where a rigid brace would break fragile material.",
    attitude:
      "It bargains rather than fences: ground workers signal kite pilots " \
      "which parts of a shower front the grove can receive, and its teams " \
      "plant boundary beds for the Displacement Council at Bloom cordons. " \
      "When opponents raise the containment delay, it answers with its " \
      "maps and its growers, not with denial."

  prose <<~PROSE
    A coalition of growers, field ecologists, and resonance workers who care for #{ref :miraeth, "Miraeth"}. These surface basins took centuries of fine ringglass from #{encyclopedia_ref :glassfall_showers, "Glassfall showers"}. Their plants grew around the grains, drew crystal into bark and root, and joined living tissue to broad local fields. At dusk the oldest groves shine along their veins, giving the Conservatory its name.

    The Conservatory treats each grove as a working ecology. Food plants, water filters, structural roots, insects, fungi, and ringglass all affect the field. Removing a clear growth for instruments can change which roots carry resonance into the soil. Running a concentrator nearby can warm one terrace and leave another too quiet for its crystal-bearing seedlings.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Growing with Ringglass"
    Conservatory workers read a grove from its edges inward. Young leaves show sharp changes first: translucent spots, doubled veins, or margins that vibrate against still air. Roots carry slower structural responses that can be felt through shallow stakes driven beside them. Water moving out of the basin carries signal traces from every crystal surface it crossed.

    Work alternates between growth and use. A grove can support household heat, pumps, and careful harvesting through most of a season. After a dense shower or a long industrial draw, sections are left electrically and resonantly quiet while new grains settle into the root mat. The rest is visible. Night glow evens out, insects return to the central beds, and the sharp beat between old and new crystal fades.

    Living crystal grafts are the Conservatory's most valuable product. A cut root or branch continues adjusting its broad structural response for a time after removal. Builders use grafts where a rigid ringglass brace would transfer stress into fragile material. The grafts eventually stop growing and become ordinary crystal-bearing wood; their useful life depends on moisture, local resonance, and how violently they are asked to compensate.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "The Bloom Error"
    When the #{ref :the_silent_bloom, "Silent Bloom"} began, the Conservatory argued against immediate large-scale containment. Its records contained many examples of damaged resonance ecologies finding another balance after overdraw, fire, flood, or an unusually dense shower. Early reports from Pyre sounded like the same process at a size no grove had experienced.

    The evidence changed when the first affected roots appeared in more than one position at once. Leaves reflected plants that were not present. Water entered a bed and returned to the same channel without crossing the soil between. These were not signs of an ecology redistributing load. The physical relationships on which recovery depended were failing.

    The Conservatory joined the #{ref :bloom_coalition, "Bloom Coalition"} late in 2378. It brought living substrate maps, growers who could recognize changes before fixed instruments, and a long record of how resonance moved through mixed crystal and organic material. The delay remains part of every political account of the Coalition.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Fall and Harvest"
    The #{ref :prismwell_kite_guild, "Prismwell Kite Guild"} collects clean shower grains from the same fronts that feed the groves. A broad catch above a basin can remove a season's new crystal. Leaving every front untouched can damage leaves, contaminate water, and waste material the root mat cannot absorb.

    Ground workers now signal which parts of a front the grove can receive, and pilots narrow their catch over those paths. The arrangement produces better forecasts and fewer failed plantings. It does not settle ownership of material still falling from the sky. Sparse years make that disagreement physical: a workshop lacks clean grain while young grove beds show empty veins.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    Conservatory teams work at several Bloom cordons with the #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"}. They plant quick-rooting beds outside the damping lines and record where the roots stop behaving as connected matter. The plants do not contain a zone. They provide a cheap, living map of small boundary changes between instrument surveys.

    Miraeth remains the institution's center and its strongest evidence that resonance damage can heal when matter retains stable relationships. Bloom work keeps showing the boundary of that lesson.
