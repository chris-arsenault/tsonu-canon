  prose <<~PROSE
    The system's governance framework is a mediation structure and a set of shared norms that most settlements have agreed to honor most of the time. The memory of the Bitter Reach gives its members a common reason to preserve it.

    The #{ref :velisar_occupation, "occupation of Velisar"} in 2435 is its first armed crisis on this scale since ratification. Member governments face a commander who intends to keep what mediation asks him to surrender.

    #{embed :accord_shore, :governance}

    Each member appoints a standing delegation and can send additional specialists for a particular dispute. Delegations choose a presiding mediator from a roster accepted by both parties. The permanent secretariat maintains records, schedules hearings, and publishes the standards adopted by member vote. It cannot order a member government to act.

    The Accord relies on member organizations for enforcement. Its sanctions are reputational and economic: expulsion from the framework means losing access to the Compact's mediation, Vantara's trade infrastructure, and the legal recognition that makes inter-settlement commerce possible.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Operations"
    **Mediation.** The Accord's core function. When settlements, fabs, or factions have disputes that can't be resolved bilaterally, they bring them to the Accord's mediation process. The process is derived from the Shear Compact's model and is universally considered slow, bureaucratic, and better than the alternative.

    **Standards.** The Accord maintains system-wide standards for resonance safety, trade documentation, salvage certification (via the Compact), and communication protocols. These standards are Sitharian in origin — drafted in Sitharian legal language, reflecting Sitharian institutional assumptions — which is resented by everyone who isn't Sitharian and exploited by everyone who is.

    **Humanitarian.** The Accord's humanitarian provisions, drafted by the Displacement Council, cover refugee rights, containment support, and sovereignty protections — including the hard-won provision that habs can legally refuse contact.

    Velisar's occupation has made the framework's limits immediate. A hearing cannot open a battery gate or release a crew under an accepted command. Members can recognize representatives, keep contact between opposing cities and decide what assistance they will provide. The secretariat has no army to send.

    #{ref :sithari, "Sithari"}'s influence is structural and resented. The Accord sits in Sithari, uses Sitharian legal language, and was partly designed by Sitharian political thinkers. #{ref :the_continuity, "The Continuity"} supported combatants during the Contested Reach and Bitter Reach while the city retained its formal neutrality. Other governments remember the credit restrictions, freight delays, and institutional pressure that distinction allowed.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    The Accord's offices receive appeals from Istravan cities while #{ref :sereva, "Sereva"} prepares its own expedition. The member provisions remain in force. Ships, protection and military action come from governments and people willing to undertake them; accepting a hearing does not place those forces under the secretariat's command.

  gm_note :complicates, "A hearing needs a presiding mediator both parties accept from the roster, so an opponent can spend the first sessions striking names. The party's evidence waits behind the argument over who reads it."

  summary "The settlements ending the Bitter Reach ratified the Tempered Accord in 2423."
  prose "Born from exhaustion at the end of the #{ref :the_bitter_reach, "Bitter Reach"}. The #{ref :bloom_coalition, "Bloom Coalition"} had proved cooperation worked; the Bitter Reach proved the system couldn't survive without it; the #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} proved emergency structures could become permanent. By the time the fighting stopped the preconditions only needed writing down. Three institutions shaped it: the #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"} supplied an AI-derived governance model, #{ref :vantara, "Vantara"} the trade provisions, and the #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"} the humanitarian framework and the trusted-mediator role."
