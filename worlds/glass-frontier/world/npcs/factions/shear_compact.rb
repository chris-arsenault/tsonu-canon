    ideology:
      "Nothing that happened at Pyre gets to happen again: minimum " \
      "standards, extraction limits, and mediated claims are worth more " \
      "than any single haul. Its authority rests on that memory rather " \
      "than on force — the Compact keeps no armed arm at all.",
    methods:
      "Certification by equipment inspection, crew competency assessment, " \
      "and compliance with extraction limits; a Shear weather service " \
      "tracking debris, resonance tides, and drift events; mediation of " \
      "salvage disputes before anything reaches the Tempered Accord; and " \
      "fines sized to deter casual corner-cutting, which determined " \
      "violators simply pay as a cost of business.",
    presence:
      "Its people come as inspectors, assessors, and mediators, never as " \
      "muscle. Where a crew feels the Compact daily is the forecast — " \
      "debris, tides, drift — which is frequently wrong, the best " \
      "available, and read aloud with complaint before every crossing.",
    attitude:
      "An uncertified operator is stopped by nobody and pursued by " \
      "paperwork: the fine follows, and the crew forfeits the mediation " \
      "that settles disputed finds. Independent crews it would rather " \
      "license than chase, with uneven success."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The system's regulatory body for #{ref :the_shear, "Shear"} salvage operations. Not an enforcement agency — a standards board. The Compact sets safety requirements, certifies operators, maintains forecasting services, and issues fines when people cut corners. It has no armed enforcement arm. Its authority comes from the fact that most people, at this point, recognize the value of not repeating what happened at #{ref :pyre, "Pyre"}.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Operations"
    **Certification.** Operators who want to work the Shear legally carry a Compact certification. The process involves equipment inspection, crew competency assessment, and compliance with extraction limits. Certification doesn't guarantee safety — it guarantees minimum standards.

    **Forecasting.** The Compact maintains a Shear weather service: debris tracking, resonance tide prediction, drift event monitoring. The service is frequently wrong. It is also the best available, and everyone uses it while complaining about it.

    **Mediation.** Salvage claim disputes go through the Compact's mediation process before escalating to the #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"}. The process is bureaucratic, slow, and universally preferred to the Contested Reach's alternative of settling claims with weapons.

    **Fines.** The Compact can fine operators for safety violations. The fines are meaningful enough to deter casual corner-cutting and small enough that determined violators pay them as a cost of business. #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"} doesn't bother with certification at all, operating entirely outside the Compact's framework.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    The Compact is the Accord's proof of concept. Before the Accord existed, the Compact demonstrated that emergency cooperation could become permanent regulation. Its charter became the legal template for the Accord's governance provisions. Its mediation process became the model for the Accord's dispute resolution.

    It is also, increasingly, tested. Ringglass demand is growing. The Compact's extraction limits slow supply. Someone is always making the argument that safety standards are too conservative — the same argument #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"} made before Pyre, in different words, from different mouths. "That's what they said about Pyre" still works as a response. It won't work forever.

  gm_note :appears, "Every Shear crossing starts with the Compact's forecast of debris, resonance tides, and drift events, and the forecast is wrong often enough that reading it aloud starts an argument in the cabin. The crew flies on it regardless, because there is nothing else to fly on."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Working the Shear uncertified is stopped by nobody, since the Compact keeps no armed arm, but the fine follows and an uncertified crew loses the mediation that settles salvage claims. Their next disputed find belongs to whoever is holding it."
  gm_note :complicates, "Ringglass demand outruns what the extraction limits release, so there is always a buyer paying above the certified rate for an over-limit haul. The penalty for taking that work is a fine one profitable run absorbs, which is why determined operators keep taking it."

  summary "Salvage operators formed the Shear Compact in 2383 around shared safety standards, neutral mediation, and the evidence from Shardfall."
  prose "The Compact formed out of the #{ref :bloom_coalition, "Bloom Coalition"}'s emergency response: salvage operators who had spent the Contested Reach competing lethally found themselves cooperating on containment logistics, and realized shared safety standards would have prevented some of the disasters that led to the Bloom. #{ref :shardfall, "Shardfall"} was the political catalyst — proof that unregulated Shear work endangers everyone — and the Bloom proved the consequences could be civilizational. The charter borrowed the Coalition's neutrality provision and structured mediation."
