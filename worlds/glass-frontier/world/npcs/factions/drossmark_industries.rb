  prose <<~PROSE
    Drossmark Industries was a mid-drift extraction company built around heavy ringglass cutting arrays. Its rigs fixed several debris masses into one temporary field and drew material through them without moving the carrier between cuts. The method worked quickly in open Shear and transferred vibration across every mass held by the array.

    The company sold speed. A buyer paid for a graded load and a delivery window; Drossmark chose the claim, equipment, and losses needed to meet both. Its black hull plates carried three white cuts, a mark still visible on old loaders in private yards.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "Shardfall and Dissolution"
    At #{ref :shardfall, "Shardfall"} in 2348, Drossmark ran three linked arrays inside a debris field claimed by the #{ref :brake_free_cutters, "Brake Free Cutters"}. The field lay close enough to the neighboring hab for the extraction tone to enter its kinetic arrestors. Drossmark continued cutting after hab instruments warned that the arrestors were answering the rigs.

    The resulting cascade killed workers and residents. Ports refused Drossmark loads, insurers withdrew from its rigs, and creditors took the serviceable ships. The company dissolved in 2359. Its owners did not establish a successor.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :legacy, heading: "What Remains"
    The affected hab retains two Drossmark extraction frames with their power paths physically cut. Crews use the housings as stationary sorting tables and leave the black plates exposed. Current inspection books still illustrate linked controls with a Drossmark panel because one command could keep every array running after local crews tried to stop them.

  gm_note :appears, "The black plate with three white cuts still shows on working loaders in private yards, because the hulls outlasted the company by decades. Asking a yard owner where the hull came from is how most people first hear the name."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Proposing to link several cutting arrays under one control gets the Drossmark panel produced from an inspection book. It remains the standard illustration of a command that kept every rig running after local crews had tried to stop them."
  gm_note :complicates, "Two frames survive at the affected hab as sorting tables with their power paths physically cut. An offer to restore one for extraction has to be made to the people who cut them."
