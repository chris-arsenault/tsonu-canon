    ideology:
      "Connected habs should speak together without surrendering an " \
      "ounce of local law: any member may reject a resolution, and " \
      "membership belongs to the habitat itself, not to whoever governs " \
      "it. The assembly refuses to judge whether a Session's " \
      "instructions or a civic appointment is the more legitimate way to " \
      "send a delegation.",
    methods:
      "Sovereignty and contact questions get one voice per hab; freight " \
      "and maintenance measures weigh declared population and traffic, " \
      "so a port carries more when it accepts more work. Most " \
      "resolutions pair a common minimum with voluntary agreements among " \
      "members who need more, and the standing work is registry: who " \
      "accepts contact, which seals are compatible, what routes are " \
      "closed.",
    presence:
      "Delegation rooms and the route register at Hab Meridian, staffed " \
      "largely with relay time and clerks the big ports provide — a " \
      "dependence the smaller members resent in a nominally equal " \
      "assembly. Each delegation arrives under whatever process its own " \
      "hab recognizes.",
    attitude:
      "To anyone approaching a ring hab, it is the register consulted " \
      "first: contact terms, quarantine notices, closures. To those who " \
      "want it to compel a member, it offers a resolution at most — it " \
      "claims no right to open a hatch, inspect an interior, or seat a " \
      "delegation outsiders have sent, though it will relay a message to " \
      "a shuttered hab where a recognized channel exists."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The Ring Collective is the standing assembly through which connected ring habitats present common positions to surface governments, carriers, and the #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"}. It does not govern its members. Each hab keeps its own law and may reject a Collective resolution.

    Membership belongs to the habitat rather than its government. A hab sends one delegation under whatever local process it recognizes. Fermata's delegation receives instructions from a Session; Hab Meridian's is appointed through its civic offices. The Collective records both as one member and does not decide which procedure is more legitimate.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "Delegations"
    Delegations meet at #{ref :hab_meridian, "Hab Meridian"}, whose relays can reach the largest number of member routes without passing through a surface capital. Each hab has one voice on sovereignty and contact. Freight and maintenance measures use declared population and traffic bands, so a major port carries more weight when it accepts more work.

    The two methods produce different coalitions. Small habs can block a contact rule they consider dangerous. Large ports can refuse a maintenance schedule they would have to fund. Most resolutions therefore pair a common minimum with voluntary service agreements among the members that need more.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Shared Work"
    The Collective maintains the register of habs that accept contact, those that require advance terms, and those that have withdrawn. It publishes compatible docking seals, quarantine notices, and route closures. It also appoints ring-hab delegates to Accord panels when a dispute affects habitats that are not direct parties.

    Shuttered habs are not members. The Collective records their last known contact rule and will relay a message if a recognized channel exists. It claims no right to open a hatch, inspect an interior, or recognize a replacement delegation sent by outsiders.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Ports and Small Habs"
    Hab Meridian and other large ports provide most of the relay time, meeting space, and clerical staff. Smaller members argue that this makes a nominally equal assembly dependent on places whose economies benefit from every route it standardizes.

    The current dispute concerns emergency docking. Ports want authority to redirect a damaged vessel to any member with a compatible seal. Small habs insist that a receiving habitat must consent before the route notice goes out, even when delay leaves a ship under failing pressure.

  gm_note :appears, "An approach to any ring hab is checked against the Collective's register, which records who accepts contact, who requires terms agreed in advance, and who has withdrawn, alongside compatible docking seals, quarantine notices, and current route closures."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Asking the Collective to make a member do something produces a resolution at most. Each hab keeps its own law and may reject one, and the assembly claims no right to open a hatch, inspect an interior, or seat a delegation outsiders have sent."
  gm_note :complicates, "A damaged vessel looking for a berth lands in the assembly's open dispute: large ports want authority to redirect it to any member with a compatible seal, small habs require the receiving hab's consent first, and the route notice waits on that argument."
