    ideology:
      "A claim must show how it closes and what carries its load. The " \
      "complete triptych — including the panel some houses refuse to sound " \
      "— must be preserved and shown, with disputed lines kept by the " \
      "house that holds them. Whether the One Truth can be reached or only " \
      "named is a live argument, not a settled one.",
    methods:
      "Open houses copy, compare, and teach the figures through handwork, " \
      "sound, and recitation of the shared lines; study circles trace the " \
      "lattice figures by hand before any frame is sounded. Keepers " \
      "witness contracts and reconciliations, certifying that a statement " \
      "is complete, never that it was wise.",
    presence:
      "Keepers at three flat frames — a gold tetrahedron braced with " \
      "weighted cords, a red triangulum turned through its measured arc, " \
      "the third frame open — with a row of loose crystal slips answering " \
      "between them, and every joint offered for inspection first.",
    attitude:
      "Anyone may study without joining and anyone may ask for a witness. " \
      "Between houses, disagreement travels politely from door to door " \
      "with the keepers who carry it."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The Tessellan Communion keeps the devotional tradition of #{encyclopedia_ref :the_three_forms, "the Three Forms"}. Its houses preserve complete triptychs, teach the figures through handwork and sound, and receive anyone who wants to study the tradition without entering an order. Members are called keepers because their first duty is to maintain an accurate copy and make it available.

    The Communion formed in 2216 when isolated Tuner households brought surviving panels to Sithari for comparison. No two copies agreed in every line, but the Tetrahedron, Triangulum, False Form, and closing sentence appeared in all of them. The keepers copied the shared figures onto stone and left disputed lines in the house that held them.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Practice"
    A service begins with three frames laid flat. Keepers brace the gold tetrahedron with weighted cords, turn the red triangulum through a measured arc, and leave the third frame open. A low structural tone holds the first. A kinetic pulse moves the second. The signal between them is heard through a row of loose crystal slips that answer without forming a stable chord.

    Participants inspect every joint before the figures are sounded. A hidden brace or a forced seam invalidates the demonstration. The work teaches the Communion's ordinary moral rule: a claim must show how it closes and what carries its load. Keepers are often asked to witness contracts, repair accounts, and reconciliations. They certify the completeness of the statement, not whether either party chose well.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "The Third Panel"
    Communion houses disagree about the #{ref :the_false_form, "False Form"}. Some teach that it depicts a real pressure against coherent matter and should never be sounded. Others treat it as a precise drawing of a path that only appears closed, useful because it exposes the concealed break. Both keep the panel in every complete triptych.

    They also disagree about the One Truth. Some houses train toward a tone in which structural and kinetic responses coincide. Others hold that the phrase names a limit no instrument or person can reach. The disagreement changes practice: the first group uses guarded resonance arrays in instruction, while the second permits only diagrams and unpowered frames.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    The Communion's principal house stands in #{ref :old_campus, "the Old Campus"}, close enough to share instruments and arguments with the Sithari Clarisant chapter. The Clarisant recognizes no devotional exercise as Tuner training. It does inspect the powered arrays used by Communion houses and closes any that exceed public teaching limits.

    Several houses have asked for a common ruling on whether novices may sound the lawful figures before receiving a Clarisant credential. The Communion has no single leader who can issue one. Each house has published its own answer beside its triptych, and traveling keepers carry the differences from one house to the next.

  gm_note :appears, "Anyone can ask a keeper to witness a contract, a repair account, or a settlement, and keepers are asked constantly. The keeper certifies that the statement shows how it closes and what carries its load, then declines to say whether the bargain was a good one."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Ask a house for the tradition's ruling and you get that house's answer, posted beside its own triptych, because no leader can issue a common one. The same split decides whether the house teaches with guarded arrays or with diagrams and unpowered frames."
  gm_note :complicates, "Everyone present handles the frames before they are sounded, and a hidden brace or forced seam voids the demonstration. A character carrying a concealed device, or wanting the tone produced quickly, has to get past a room of people checking every joint."
