  log "Settled: a neutral containment order, focused on maintaining Bloom Zone cordons. Trusted by all factions because it stayed out of the Bitter Reach, and stretched thin as a result."

  log "2026-08-21 — The Karet families' supervised-entry request now begins a remote-recovery compromise. One new major zone forces closures and longer rotations; a second simultaneous opening forces the Council to choose which boundary receives full coverage."

  prose <<~PROSE
    A neutral containment order born from the #{ref :displacement, "Displacement"} refugee crisis. The Council maintains #{ref :bloom_zones, "Bloom Zone"} containment cordons, provides humanitarian support to displaced communities, and serves as a trusted mediator precisely because they refused to take sides during the Bitter Reach.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Operations"
    **Containment.** The Council's primary mission. Cordon stations around every known #{ref :bloom_zones, "Bloom Zone"}, crewed by rotating teams who monitor the zones' boundaries and deploy damping buoys when expansion threatens. The containment technology is based on #{ref :liras_wall, "Lira's Wall"} — #{encyclopedia_ref :stillwater, "stillwater"} resonance dampers that calm the cascade frequencies along zone boundaries. Each buoy represents #{encyclopedia_ref :stillwater, "stillwater"} that the #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"} wishes were storing history instead of holding back reality tears.

    **Humanitarian.** The Council still supports displaced communities — settlement integration, resource advocacy, cultural preservation for Bloom diaspora populations.

    **Recruitment.** The Council draws from Bloom survivors, #{encyclopedia_ref :resonant_tuner, "Tuners"} willing to work in extreme resonance conditions, and #{encyclopedia_ref :fae, "fae"} whose spatial dislocation management skills translate directly to Bloom Zone operations. #{encyclopedia_ref :gnomes, "Gnomes"} are valuable for calibration but strictly exposure-limited.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Remote Reach"
    Since #{ref :pell_four, "Pell Four"}, the Council has adapted #{encyclopedia_ref :claim_coupling, "Claim Coupling"} for containment work. A coupled cutter can place an instrument, move damping mass, or recover a damaged buoy from a boundary that would be lethal to an EVA team.

    Council cutters work one boundary section at a time. Each has an isolated clock, a named field operator, and a stop condition agreed before launch. The recovery route is planned with the same care as the outward cut. If a remote tool cannot be brought home, the crew must know what signal and material it leaves inside the zone.

    The method extends the Council's reach and adds another system that a thin cordon team must maintain. #{ref :outside, "Outside"} now keeps two modified cutters beside its buoy stores. They remain idle during ordinary wall work and deploy when a mount cannot be reached from the boundary walk.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Return Requests"
    The Karet families have asked for supervised entry to recover household records, remains, and tools from #{ref :karet_three, "Karet-3"}. The Council still refuses a physical crossing. It now permits remote recovery from a stable boundary: families rank the requested objects, a cutter reaches the site, and the #{ref :karet_spool, "Karet Spool"} holds a return route for equipment that can be brought out without a person entering. The compromise recovers little and does not authorize resettlement, but it gives other displaced communities a procedure they can demand.

    Existing cordons already consume the Council's trained wall crews and stillwater allotment. One new major zone would close humanitarian offices, lengthen rotations, and leave smaller stations on remote watch. A second opening before those crews returned would force the First Threshold to choose between a failing established cordon and the new boundary. Neutrality cannot supply a team that does not exist.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Tensions"
    The Council is stretched thin. The zones are expanding slowly. The stillwater supply for damping buoys depends on the Conclave's willingness to provide it — a willingness that is real but grudging. New zones appear in unpredictable locations. #{ref :the_fracture, "The Fracture"}'s Bloom manifestations are outside the Council's operational range.

    The Council's neutrality is its greatest asset and its greatest constraint. Trusted by everyone, controlled by no one, funded by voluntary contributions from factions that could stop contributing at any time. The Accord's humanitarian provisions support the Council formally, but "formal support" means budgets subject to political negotiation.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    #{ref :dern_talish, "Dern Talish"} leads. Containment holds. The zones have not contracted. Outside keeps Karet-3 stable, and the closed boundary at Pell remains under observation because its array records still contain fragments of #{ref :pell_answer, "the Pell Answer"}.
