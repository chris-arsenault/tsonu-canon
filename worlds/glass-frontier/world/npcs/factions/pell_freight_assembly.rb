    ideology:
      "Working crews should own their own network: one member, one vote, " \
      "however many vessels the member runs, and lenders never sit the " \
      "route council. Whoever will bear the cost of a decision speaks " \
      "before anyone votes on it, and a debt like Pell Four belongs to the " \
      "members, not to anyone else.",
    methods:
      "Five elected route factors publish schedules, set the common safety " \
      "rules, and decide which losses the pooled fund covers; they cannot " \
      "order a member ship to fly, only withhold docks, insurance, and " \
      "freight access until the argument settles. Cargo dues and work " \
      "credits pay for the network — a crew short of cash takes " \
      "maintenance watches, rescue standby, or an empty return leg.",
    presence:
      "Flight crews, yards, cargo hands, claim operators, and resonance " \
      "staff working shared receiving yards and freight junctions on the " \
      "Pell approaches. A meeting runs like a claim board: hazard named " \
      "first, price second, the person accepting the risk on their feet " \
      "before the vote. Since the Emergence, every remote array clock in " \
      "the network runs separately and the on-site Tuner can stop the " \
      "work alone.",
    attitude:
      "Outside money may lend to the Assembly and will never vote in it. " \
      "When Pell Four came, it did not argue jurisdiction — it closed the " \

  prose <<~PROSE
    A member-owned freight and extraction network based in #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"}. Its voting shares belong to working crews, repair yards, claim brokers, and cargo cooperatives. A member may own several vessels but holds one vote. Outside investors can lend to the Assembly but cannot sit its route council.

    The Assembly moves bulk freight through the outer Pell routes and equips remote claims in the #{ref :deep_shear, "Deep Shear"}. It grew large enough to run industrial arrays while retaining the habits of people who expect to meet the crew that bears the cost of a decision.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "Formation"
    The first members organized during the #{ref :the_bitter_reach, "Bitter Reach"}, when freight contracts were being broken faster than independent crews could price the risk. They pooled replacement parts, guaranteed one another's cargo losses, and set a common refusal rate for routes that lacked rescue coverage. The arrangement survived the fighting because it solved ordinary problems after the emergency ended.

    Claim brokers joined next, followed by #{encyclopedia_ref :ratters, "Ratter"} crews who wanted access to heavy receiving bays without selling their claims. The Assembly financed shared yards at Glasswake and a line of freight junctions on the Pell approaches. Members pay for the network through cargo dues and work credits. A crew that cannot meet a cash call can take maintenance watches, rescue standby, or an empty return leg instead.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :structure, heading: "The Route Council"
    Each class of work elects a route factor: flight crews, yards, cargo hands, claim operators, and resonance staff. The five factors publish schedules, set the common safety rules, and decide which losses the pooled fund will cover. They cannot order a member ship to fly. They can refuse it Assembly docks, insurance, and freight access, which usually settles the argument.

    #{ref :daro_venn, "Daro Venn"} is the current senior factor. He came out of Ratter brokerage and still conducts meetings like a claim board: the hazard is named first, the price second, and the person accepting it speaks before anyone votes.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :operations, heading: "Pell Work"
    The Assembly's Deep Shear business is built around #{encyclopedia_ref :claim_coupling, "Claim Coupling"}. Member coupling crews work unstable seams; shared receiving yards sort the returns; heavy haulers take separated cargoes inward. The system reduces exposure and gives small crews access to processing capacity they could not finance alone.

    Its weakness is coordination. Shared clocks keep berths and haulers moving, and pooled losses reward uniform procedure. At #{ref :pell_cut, "Pell Cut"}, the Assembly extended that discipline to four extraction arrays. The synchronized test triggered #{ref :pell_four, "Pell Four"}.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :culture, heading: "People Between Voyages"
    Some member households arrange their leave together. Those returning from #{ref :naloven, "Naloven"}'s baths bring fruit sheets, bad imitations of quarry songs and a taste for #{encyclopedia_ref :tovan, "tovan"}. Bouts now draw crews to one another's cleared floors while ships lie at berth. Passengers lend their own techniques, and the next departure carries a different favorite move.

    Aboard #{ref :steady_return, "Steady Return"}, the schoolroom benches move aside for visiting players. Other members prefer a meal and a chance to hear the latest recording from home. Families bring #{encyclopedia_ref :old_proof, "bread"} and small presents when their voyages overlap. An invitation to one ship's table gives a newcomer friends among that household; members with no taste for crowded evenings keep their doors shut without surrendering their place in the Assembly.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "After the Emergence"
    The Assembly closed the affected routes, surrendered its array records, and put its repair crews under #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"} direction until the boundary was gone. Members voted to keep Daro in office after a long open meeting at Glasswake. They also separated every remote array clock in the network and gave on-site #{encyclopedia_ref :resonant_tuner, "Tuners"} independent stop authority.

    Pell remains expensive. The pooled fund pays cordon costs, interrupted contracts, and the crews who dismantle the synchronized equipment. Members argue over how long those payments should continue. They do not dispute that the debt belongs to them.

  gm_note :triggered_by, "Someone eventually asks the Assembly to send a ship or order a crew somewhere. The five route factors cannot direct a member vessel; they can withhold docks, insurance, and freight access, so the pressure reaches a member through the ledger rather than through an order."
