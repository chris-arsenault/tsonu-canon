  prose <<~PROSE
    Senior route factor of the #{ref :pell_freight_assembly, "Pell Freight Assembly"}, former #{encyclopedia_ref :ratters, "Ratter"} captain, and the public sponsor of the four-array test at #{ref :pell_cut, "Pell Cut"}. Daro's case for the test was simple: machines should absorb the losses that crews had been carrying home.

    He knew the machinery and the people who worked it. That knowledge made the proposal credible, won the vote, and left him answerable when the synchronized arrays formed a boundary.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "From Claims to Routes"
    Daro flew small claims before he brokered them. He earned a long-rat's trust by finding buyers who honored mass grades after delivery and by refusing contracts whose rescue coverage existed only on paper. When the Assembly formed, he brought in crews that would not otherwise have joined a freight institution.

    Route work suited him. He remembers which yard can repair an old cutter head, which master will accept a difficult return load, and which crew has already spent its tolerance for risk. His authority rests on those particulars. Assembly meetings become hostile when he treats a schedule as more important than one of them.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :tensions, heading: "Pell"
    Daro argued that four synchronized arrays would finish the Pell claims quickly and reduce total exposure. He accepted the stop conditions proposed by the #{encyclopedia_ref :resonant_tuner, "Tuners"}, then let the test continue through early signs that separated receivers were answering in the same cadence. By the time he ordered shutdown, the pattern held without the arrays.

    During the closure he stayed at Pell Cut, opened the Assembly's records, and assigned its haulers and repair crews to the Council. Some members kept him in office because he did this. Others voted against him because it came after the decision that mattered.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    Daro works from the Assembly yard in #{ref :glasswake, "Glasswake"} and spends every sixth shift at Pell. He signs each cordon payment before the route council releases ordinary freight accounts. He also continues to defend remote cutting, now with isolated clocks and local stop authority.

    Crews still take his contracts. They read the hazard lines more closely than they once did.
