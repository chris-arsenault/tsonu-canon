  prose <<~PROSE
    Station lead at #{ref :gray_line, "Gray Line"} and Dern Talish's oldest colleague from the cordons. Iro Senn manages the wall watch, family recovery requests, and the crews sent to service the outer mounts. He distrusts ceremonial inspections and sends Dern blunt private reports because she asked him never to improve bad news for headquarters.

    Senn remained at Gray Line when Dern moved into regional command. Their friendship consists mostly of shift notes, arguments over exposure limits, and one shared meal whenever she visits.
