  prose <<~PROSE
    Venn Talis is the sole surviving member of the team that forced entry into Hab Coriolis during the Contested Reach. Their testimony established that the sealed community had its own law, food system, obligations, and account of the surrounding world. The contact team entered as rescuers and appeared inside that account as an invasion.

    Venn gave the complete statement once to a public inquiry and answered technical questions during the first sovereignty hearings. They then left survey work, refused office, and stopped appearing at commemorations held in the dead team's name.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "The Coriolis Record"
    The surviving record combines Venn's spoken testimony, suit telemetry, the team's entry plan, and the outer-hatch recording. Venn required later copies to preserve all four. The suit record shows the team's fear and confusion. The plan shows that the faction had already described the inhabitants as stranded people unable to consent.

    Accord mediators study the record before approaching a community that restricts contact. Venn permits that use and refuses condensed versions that turn Coriolis into a warning about hostile habs.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Limited Correspondence"
    Venn answers written questions from mediators and closed-community delegates through the Echo Ledger Conclave's Sithari archive office. The replies distinguish observation from inference and leave questions unanswered when the record does not support an answer.

    Requests to identify the faction that mounted the entry receive the same response: its later name matters less than the authority it claimed at the hatch. Venn has not joined the effort to remove the name from sealed inquiry records.

  gm_note :appears, "Venn is reached by written question through the #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"}'s Sithari archive office, never in person and never at short notice. The reply separates what the record shows from what Venn inferred, and leaves anything the record cannot support unanswered."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Asking which faction mounted the entry produces the same sentence every time: the name matters less than the authority it claimed at the hatch. The name survives in the sealed inquiry records, and there is a standing effort to strike it that Venn has neither joined nor opposed."
  gm_note :complicates, "Venn refuses condensed versions of the Coriolis record, so a party wanting a quick briefing gets all four parts or none: the spoken testimony, the suit telemetry, the team's entry plan, and the outer-hatch recording."
