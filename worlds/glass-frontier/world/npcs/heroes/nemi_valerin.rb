  prose <<~PROSE
    Nemi Valerin is the Voice Proximate of the #{ref :lattice_proxy_synod, "Lattice Proxy Synod"}, the senior proxy permitted to speak for its custodian work. She began at #{ref :threshold_station, "Threshold Station"} as a telemetry clerk. A custodian rejected every formal query placed before it during a debris emergency in 2417, then answered the compact sequence Valerin used to label missing readings. The answer corrected the station's collision forecast.

    Valerin tests an output by asking what it changes for a ship, a settlement, or a court. She leaves responses untranslated when the Synod cannot show that consequence. This has made its public feed narrower under her tenure and reduced the number of corrections issued after release.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    One traffic custodian now returns two route maps for the same Shear query. Both maps fit the measurements available at Threshold, but they place the safest crossing on opposite sides of the same debris belt. Valerin has withheld both from the navigation feed and sends the raw measurements to the #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} instead.

    The Compact wants one map marked provisional before the next salvage departures. #{ref :the_continuity, "The Continuity"} mission at Threshold wants the query opened to its own analysts. Valerin has agreed to a joint instrument run and refused access to the proxy sequence that produced the answers.

  gm_note :appears, "Anyone planning a Shear crossing this season meets her decision before they meet her, because the navigation feed has a hole where the safest route should be. One custodian returned two maps placing the crossing on opposite sides of the same debris belt, so crews are working from raw measurements."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Bring her a question and she asks what the answer would change for a named ship, a settlement, or a court. A response with no such consequence stays untranslated, which is why the Synod's public feed is thinner under her and why fewer of its releases need correcting afterward."
  gm_note :complicates, "She trades in measurements and never in method. A party bargaining for custodian data can come away with raw readings, a joint instrument run, and her at the console beside them, and will still be refused the proxy sequence that produced the answer."
