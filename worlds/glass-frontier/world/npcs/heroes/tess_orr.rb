  prose <<~PROSE
    Tess Orr maps difficult textiles at #{ref :thirty_one, "Thirty-One"}. She reads the order in which a garment accumulated dirt, pressure, repairs, and resonance, then chooses a wash that separates those layers.

    Orr learned on sailcloth, where one careless cycle can erase a route beacon or move it into a later patch. She tests every treatment on thread removed from an existing repair. The test becomes part of the job record and returns to the owner in a small glass tube.

    She first found the repeated voice in the #{ref :red_sleeve, "Red Sleeve"}. Her arrangement of the later garments turns its directions into a continuous route toward Wash Four's sealed axis.

  gm_note :complicates, "She learned on sailcloth and refuses a wash order that could push a route beacon into a later patch, which puts her against anyone who wants the cloth clean faster than they want it readable."
