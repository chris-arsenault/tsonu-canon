  prose <<~PROSE
    Sora Meralis is Chief Ledgrist of the #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"}. She spent her field years authenticating records used in inheritance and salvage claims, where a missing line could move a home or a cargo hold from one claimant to another. Her seals include the evidence examined, the evidence refused, and the part of a finding that rests on interpretation.

    The senior archivists elected her in 2433 after she proposed publishing catalogue descriptions for restricted holdings without releasing the recordings themselves. The descriptions have exposed duplicate names, unlisted gaps, and access rules that differ between adjoining galleries. Correcting those records has brought her support from working archivists and resistance from keepers of the older vaults.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Present Day"
    The #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"} has requested the new catalogue for every holding cited in a public ruling. Meralis will release titles, dates, and the reason each item is restricted. She refuses to release private voices or the locations of active Echo River sites.

    Three senior archivists have called for a new vote before the catalogue leaves #{ref :thornvault, "Thornvault"}. Meralis continues to sign releases from the upper gallery while the ballots are prepared. Any release already sealed remains valid even if she loses the office.
  PROSE

  gm_note :appears, "Her catalogue corrections reach the party as paperwork trouble: one holding entered under two names, a gap nobody had listed, an access rule that differs between adjoining galleries they already have permission for."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Ask Meralis for a restricted holding and she gives the title, the date and the reason it is closed, without the recording. Private voices and the locations of active #{ref :kaleidos_echo_rivers, "Echo River"} sites she refuses outright."
  gm_note :complicates, "Three senior archivists have called a vote on her office while she keeps signing releases from #{ref :thornvault, "Thornvault"}'s upper gallery. A sealed release survives her losing, so both sides of a dispute have reason to move before the ballots are counted."
