  prose <<~PROSE
    The Dissident was an elf who rejected the collective disappearance after the Glassfall. They judged that leaving isolated communities without resonance knowledge would kill people more certainly than one concealed teacher would expose the hidden habs.

    In 2160 they entered a surface settlement under a human name and began teaching practical Tuning. The lessons covered sensing an active band, separating signal from structural response, and stopping before a coupled field ran away. They withheld the elven notation and instruments that would have revealed the source.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "The Teaching Line"
    The first students carried the lessons to nearby settlements as repair work. Each school adapted the exercises to local glass and surviving tools. By the time later teachers compared methods, the common sequence appeared to be an unusually successful Famine practice rather than one person's instruction.

    Several techniques now standardized by the #{ref :clarisant, "Clarisant"} retain that sequence: find the quiet edge of a field, introduce one reference tone, and measure the returning interval before applying force. The guild records the oldest versions without an author.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :aftermath, heading: "Disappearance"
    The Dissident stopped teaching in 2180. Their room had been cleared, the borrowed instruments remained, and no student reported a farewell. Elven records available to the hidden leadership do not state whether an operative recalled them, killed them, or helped them move beyond the search.

    The leadership still classifies the teaching as a breach of concealment. Elves who learned resonance through descendants of that school preserve copies of the prohibited exercises alongside the order condemning them.
