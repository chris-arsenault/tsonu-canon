  prose <<~PROSE
    A #{encyclopedia_ref :gnomes, "gnome"} Shear mechanic who became the architect of #{ref :bloom_zones, "Bloom Zone"} containment. #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"}-employed before the Bloom, overlooked, blue collar. The person who figured out how to stop reality from coming apart — not through theory, but through instinct refined by years of keeping ringglass arrays stable in environments that wanted to break them.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :public_profile, heading: "Public Profile"
    Lira worked at #{ref :crowncut_refinery, "Crowncut Refinery"}, where foreman #{ref :pera_soll, "Pera Soll"} let her record adjustments that were not in any maintenance manual. Small changes to tuning and alignment kept the refinery's local resonance stable while other deep-Shear plants fought chronic failures.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :traits, heading: "Traits"
    Her gnomish biology is the foundation. The crystal-laced nervous system that every gnome carries gave her a sensory relationship with resonance that human or orc mechanics couldn't develop — she could feel when an array was drifting before instruments registered it. But gnomish attunement alone doesn't explain what she did. Plenty of gnomes work in Shear operations. Lira's specific contribution was translating instinct into a deployable technology: #{ref :liras_wall, "Lira's Wall"}.

    She is, by Coremark's standards, one piece of the corporation's partial redemption. Not enough to redeem them. But proof that the corporation wasn't uniformly rotten — that somewhere in the profit-driven machine, someone was doing careful work because careful work mattered.

    Sitharian-cultured by upbringing — the formal naming pattern, the measured speech. But her career was blue collar, her expertise was hands-on, and her contributions came from doing, not theorizing.
  PROSE
  prose <<~PROSE, section: :present_day, heading: "Cinder Gap"
    Lira now works at #{ref :cinder_gap, "Cinder Gap"}, where the oldest damping buoys have absorbed decades of uneven boundary load. Her crews can replace a buoy. They cannot safely release the resonance stored in one that has begun to saturate.

    She is developing a retirement sequence that transfers the load through neighboring mounts before the old buoy leaves the wall. The first full attempt will happen on the same cordon section where her original field array held. A failed transfer would not create a portable barrier; it would open Cinder Gap at its oldest seam.

  gm_note :appears, "Resonance trouble reaches Lira before it reaches the instruments: she names the drifting array while the gauges still read clean, and they catch up minutes later. A crew that waits for the instrument to agree spends that interval on the wrong repair."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Ask Lira why the containment holds and she walks the questioner to a mount and has them feel it through a load cycle. Players who want it written down get pointed at #{ref :vashtenri_thesis, "the thesis built from her refinery books"}, which she did not write."
  gm_note :complicates, "Lira's time is mortgaged to the oldest damping buoys at #{ref :cinder_gap, "Cinder Gap"}, which have absorbed decades of uneven load and cannot be safely emptied. Any errand that takes her off that cordon gets weighed against a buoy saturating on its own schedule, and she will say so."
