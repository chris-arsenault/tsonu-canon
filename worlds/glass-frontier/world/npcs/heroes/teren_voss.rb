  prose <<~PROSE
    The engineer who led #{ref :coremark, "Coremark"}'s #{ref :second_span_trial, "Second Span trial"}. Voss aligned the trial's relay chain, signed the order that abandoned it, and kept copies of the anomalous readings after Coremark closed the project.

    He now repairs municipal signal gear in #{ref :keelward, "Keelward"}. Researchers still bring him conduit proposals. He will inspect them, mark the coupled loads they have overlooked, and refuse any work intended to make a second Span.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "The Trial Record"
    Voss argued that the aligned anchor chain remained active after the test equipment shut down. Coremark treated the residual readings as an accounting problem and ordered the site stripped. He sent his copies to the #{ref :shear_compact, "Shear Compact"} after the #{ref :the_silent_bloom, "Silent Bloom"}; those records now provide the clearest route by which the first cascade crossed the mid-drift.

  gm_note :appears, "Voss is who Keelward calls when municipal signal gear fails, which puts the man holding the #{ref :second_span_trial, "Second Span trial"} telemetry at an ordinary repair bench. Investigators tracing the first cascade across the mid-drift end up there."
