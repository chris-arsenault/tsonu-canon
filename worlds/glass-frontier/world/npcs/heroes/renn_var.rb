  prose <<~PROSE
    Renn Var cuts recorded ringglass at #{ref :talven, "Talven"}. She made Var's Wedge after metal tools scattered the signal in a damaged archive face. Her hands appear in the recording held by the first plate she lifted with it: a blurred pair of shadows crossing an older work crew's voices.

    Var now leads the Sixth Bench archive cut. She marks each intended plate with a white grain line and seats the wedge herself. Apprentices handle the dampers, listening points, and finished plates until their readings match hers across three cuts.
