  log "2026-09-15 — Moved the elven briefing into DM prose, consistent with Dern's hidden 2432 read-in; the public handover remains visible."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The third First Threshold of the #{ref :displacement_council, "Displacement Council"}, in office from 2421 until his death in 2432. Oram Sells inherited a mature cordon service with exhausted crews, uneven records, and more boundaries than its founders had planned to hold. He standardized handoffs between stations and required each cordon to maintain a recovery ledger for the families outside it.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :truth, heading: "The Last Briefing", dm: true
    Sells disclosed the hidden elven cooperation to #{ref :dern_talish, "Dern Talish"} at #{ref :gray_line, "Gray Line"} and gave her the contact protocol. She confirmed his account through the communication shard. His public transfer of command did not disclose that arrangement to the Council.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :history, heading: "Succession"
    Bloom exposure accumulated across #{elapsed 2421, 2432} of inspections. When the damage became terminal, Sells chose #{ref :dern_talish, "Dern Talish"} as his successor and spent his final season transferring the Council's ordinary command. The final transfer of command took place at #{ref :gray_line, "Gray Line"}.
