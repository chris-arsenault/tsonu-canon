  summary "Var's Wedge is a hand instrument for separating thin ringglass plates without destroying the signals recorded in them. Cael Var made it at Talven, which keeps the shortening original for mapped archive cuts."

  prose <<~PROSE
    Twelve intact plates came from the first archive face cut with Var's Wedge. Talven cutter #{ref :cael_var, "Cael Var"} made the tool from a clear offcut, a ceramic heel, and a grip wrapped in lift cable after every metal edge broke the recorded signal. The archive manifest attached her name to the successful instrument.

    A user seats the clear edge along the crystal grain and taps the ceramic heel. The wedge answers the signal held in the layer and carries the same vibration through its grip. Pressure applied during that return opens a flat fracture behind the recording and leaves the signal-bearing face whole.

    The edge has shortened through repeated dressing. Talven keeps the instrument at the Sixth Bench and assigns it to archive cuts whose surrounding layer has already been mapped. Several workshops can reproduce its shape. Their copies split glass cleanly and scatter the recorded signal across both faces.

  gm_note :appears, "Whoever taps the ceramic heel feels the recording come back up through the wrapped grip, so the player holding the wedge hears the layer a moment before the crew at the listening points does."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Several workshops will cut a copy of the wedge within a day. The copy splits the glass just as cleanly and scatters the recording across both new faces, so what it lifts grades as instrument stock rather than as an archive plate."
  gm_note :complicates, "Talven issues the original only for cuts whose surrounding layer has already been mapped, so a request to use it on a fresh face means paying for or working a mapping shift first."
