  prose <<~PROSE, section: :description, heading: "The Weekly Signal"
    The transmitter activates on a seven-day interval measured by its own clock. It sends a short exchange in pre-Glassfall Sitharian: a location request, an acknowledgement, and a final sentence whose middle two words vary. No receiver in the current system has answered it.

    The Ratter inspection crews have recordings from fourteen consecutive years. Signal strength has not declined. Attempts to read the transmitter from outside the Fragment return only the held tone, and navigation systems on unescorted research vessels tend to route around the site before it comes into instrument range.
