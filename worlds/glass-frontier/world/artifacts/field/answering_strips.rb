    appearance: "Two hand-length sheets of dark foil with matching start folds and different stop creases. One has " \
                "been cut to Thornvault's archive outline; the other retains Pell's rectangular field sleeve.",
    handling: "A dead-room playback gives the distress call and then Quiet Measure's acknowledgment along the same " \
              "physical margin. First-generation copies keep the call and lose the answer.",
    risks: "Heat and refolding damage the grain paths, while playback near responsive material can release part of " \
           "the record into the room. Every comparison therefore consumes some of the evidence."

  prose <<~PROSE
    #{ref :quiet_measure, "*Quiet Measure*"} carried the two strips on its isolated receiver after a repeated distress pattern appeared beyond Pell. Both captured the call. Both also hold the tender's acknowledgment along the same physical margin, although the ship's transmitter remained disconnected.

    Pell sent one original to Thornvault and kept the other in the rescue office. The #{ref :echo_ledger_conclave, "Echo Ledger Conclave"} authenticated their folds and materials. Playback copies omit the acknowledgment after the first generation; the originals continue to give the response inside a dead room.

    A comparison at #{ref :cold_lantern, "Cold Lantern"} made the passive route recorder answer after the strip had stopped. The recorder held no copy of the distress call and repeated only the tender's acknowledgment.

  gm_note :appears, "The two originals are separated between Pell and Thornvault, so any direct comparison requires moving one irreplaceable record through the routes that produced it."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Playing an original into a new strip preserves the distress call and drops the acknowledgment, destroying exactly the feature the listener needs to compare."
  gm_note :complicates, "Cold Lantern's passive recorder answered only after playback stopped, making the safest comparison site part of the unexplained response."
