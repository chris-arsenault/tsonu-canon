    appearance: "A cargo lot of dark grains, none larger than a seed, each producing the faint harmonic hum Tuners find unsettling.",
    working: "Its substance is lawful under the Tempered Accord, but its cordoned source puts the lot into the legal gray area Coremark's black-market routes serve.",
    risks: "The grains release stored resonance across the full spectrum, and prolonged handling narrows perception until a carrier mistakes which side of a bulkhead a sound came from."

  prose <<~PROSE
    The Wrong-Side Lot moves through Coremark's black-market channels from a cordoned Bloom deposit. The substance is not illegal under the #{ref :tempered_accord, "Tempered Accord"}, but its source is, and enforcement treats the difference as a dark gray area.

    Each grain stores concentrated resonance across an unstable range of frequencies. Controlled release requires narrow-bandwidth skill. An uncontrolled release is disruptive at minimum and catastrophic at small scale.
  PROSE

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :origin, heading: "The Lot's Source"
    Like all duskgrain, the lot is physical residue of the #{ref :the_false_form, "False Form"}'s pressure: fragments of a geometry that cannot close, crystallized into matter that nonetheless persists. The dealers who move it know only that it came from behind a cordon.
  PROSE

  gm_note :appears, "The lot's legality turns on where it was dug rather than on the grain itself: the Accord permits the substance and cordons the ground it came from."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Opening or testing a grain risks releasing its stored resonance across the full spectrum at once."
  gm_note :complicates, "Someone who has handled the lot for years hears narrow-band work nobody else notices and mistakes which side of a bulkhead a sound came from."
