    handling: "Work begins with remote taps and isolated samples; Lira Vashtenri prohibits opening it until a crew can show where its stored frequencies will go.",

  prose <<~PROSE
    Three original casings remain mounted behind the current wall at #{ref :cinder_gap, "Cinder Gap"}. Their stillwater has absorbed more cascade activity than any other surviving containment vessel. One no longer accepts calibration. The Returning Casing gives back a faint version of every test tone applied to it.

    Lira Vashtenri now uses Cinder Gap to develop a retirement procedure for saturated buoys. The work begins with remote taps and isolated samples. Opening a casing remains prohibited until the crew can show where its stored frequencies will go.

  gm_note :appears, "Instrument work anywhere near the old mounts picks up a second voice, because the Returning Casing gives back a faint version of every test tone applied to it. Crews new to the section read that as a fault in their own equipment and lose an hour chasing it."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Proposing to open the saturated casing gets a condition rather than a refusal: Lira Vashtenri requires the crew to show where the stored frequencies will go once the vessel is breached."
