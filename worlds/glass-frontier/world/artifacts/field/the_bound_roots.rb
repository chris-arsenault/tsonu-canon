  prose <<~PROSE
    A fast-growing velin form has appeared in the cool root chambers beyond its transfer room. It follows condensation lines along walls and binds cleanly to the roots stored there. The affected plants remain healthy and carry sensation when growers touch their outer bark.

    Olven has opened a separate market stall for the bound roots and assigned one empty chamber to their cultivation. Buyers from surface clinics and ship gardens have placed orders before the first harvest.

    The first test cut made every bound root in the chamber contract at once and silenced sensation in three control grafts across the transfer room. Growers closed the stall with the orders still posted. Root keepers want the cool stock separated intact; clinic buyers have offered to fund a destructive harvest if Olven releases the complete lineage record with it.
