    appearance: "Squat three-footed clamps with blue-backed ringglass cores and lot plates beside the hand wheel. " \
                "Traced examples retain their plates; untraced machines show fresh grinding around the same screws.",

  prose <<~PROSE
    The blue-backed cores were cut from one apparently uniform ringglass lot. Later tests found two overlapping structural responses. One stillweight tore itself apart during road work; another pulled a cargo rail sideways before its operator released it.

    #{ref :counterweight, "The Counterweight"} published the lot marks and moved traced machines to #{ref :blue_step_works, "Blue Step Works"} for inspection. The recalled clamps include road-rig equipment and machines used to hold loose stock during remote cuts. Several examples with ground-off plates remain unaccounted for.

  gm_note :appears, "A blue-backed core or a ground-off lot plate ends a secondhand sale and starts a comparison with Counterweight's recall list."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Opening a traced machine under changing load makes the two responses visible only after each fragment has chosen a different anchor."
  gm_note :complicates, "The missing machines are ordinary working clamps until their load changes, so every yard using one has reason to conceal its plate."
