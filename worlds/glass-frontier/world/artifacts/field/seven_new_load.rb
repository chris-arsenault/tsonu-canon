    appearance: "A sealed cargo in the replacement seventh hold of Nine Holds, covered by a valid Korvathi ceramic manifest.",
    working: "The ship's sounder records insulating tile and instrument-grade ringglass responses in alternating tests; Keelward will not release it into a warehouse and the insurer will not cover an exterior opening.",
    risks: "The consignee refuses the ringglass duty while the partners charge for a voyage the ship cannot finish with the cargo still attached."

  prose <<~PROSE
    #{ref :nine_holds, "*Nine Holds*"} is berthed at #{ref :keelward, "Keelward"} while three offices argue over the Seven-New Load. The sealed cargo entered as Korvathi insulating tile. Its receiver declared instrument-grade #{encyclopedia_ref :ringglass, "ringglass"} after the ship crossed the inner corridor. The ship's own sounder records both responses in alternating tests.

    Keelward will not release the box into a warehouse. The insurer will not cover an exterior opening. The consignee has produced a valid ceramic manifest and refuses the ringglass duty. The partners have isolated Seven-new, discharged every other hold, and begun charging the consignee for a voyage the ship cannot finish while the cargo remains attached.
