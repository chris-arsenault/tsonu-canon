  prose <<~PROSE
    *Third Window* belongs to a Deep-running Ratter crew and returns to Clarisant after every use. Its matched ringglass strips and stillwater compartments hide the small field changes made by one fitted Tuner's active perception. They do not conceal a drive, an instrument sweep, or a path a hushmaw has already fixed.

    The crew used the hood on a retreat course after #{ref :empty_bearing, "the Empty Bearing"} appeared across the Pell routes. The third compartment came back underweight and was replaced as part of a matched set. The old inspection window remains on the arm so a borrower can see which failure changed the frame.

  gm_note :appears, "Third Window is licensed, fitted, and usually assigned elsewhere; getting it quickly means borrowing a frame tuned to another person's resting response."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "When the three shoulder taps fall into step, the hood is following an external pattern and the partner on the line must open it."
  gm_note :complicates, "The wearer cannot actively check whether the danger passed without producing the perception change the hood was fitted to conceal."
