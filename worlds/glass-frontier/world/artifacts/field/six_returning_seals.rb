  prose <<~PROSE
    One seal was fixed inside every lid of #{ref :returning_pods, "the Returning Pods"}. All six carry current impressions from Clearance Eight's eight desks in their proper order. Their ceramic shows handling wear from journeys older than those impressions.

    #{ref :clearance_eight, "Clearance Eight"} keeps the seals with their pods in one powered custody row. #{ref :tangent, "Tangent"} carries a reader loaded with all six sequences while it follows the pods' approach beyond the cleared lane.

  gm_note :appears, "Every returned object arrived under a complete current seal, so the desks can release it only by accepting findings none of them remembers making."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "Comparing a seal with its desk reproduces the same tool, hand pressure, and room tone while the older wear remains unchanged."
  gm_note :complicates, "The seals are complete enough to close the claims and unexplained enough to keep them open, adding storage debt to every claimant."
