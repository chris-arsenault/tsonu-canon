  prose <<~PROSE
    Clarisant keeps *The Load Note* for training, rescue commissions, and instrument certification. Tuners learn to steady a damaged frame or suspended load against its deck brace before taking the horn into a working vessel.

    The horn descends from the free-tuned construction demonstrated by #{ref :open_reed, "the Open Reed"}. Its collars narrow the working field for metal, stone, fluid, or a vessel frame, while the rear bell exposes tones the body cannot hold safely.
