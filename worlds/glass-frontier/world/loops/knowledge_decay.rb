  prose <<~PROSE
    *A recurring pattern in the loss and reinvention of ring-era technical knowledge.*

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :description, heading: "Pattern"
    ### Stage 1: Knowledge

    A deep understanding exists — of a system, a technology, a phenomenon. The understanding is held by specialists and enables capabilities that non-specialists depend on without fully grasping.

    ### Stage 2: Overuse

    The knowledge enables exploitation that outpaces the understanding. The specialists can't or don't constrain the users. The system is pushed beyond its safe operating parameters, often for economic or political reasons that override technical caution.

    ### Stage 3: Loss

    A catastrophe, departure, or institutional failure removes the specialists or destroys the knowledge base. What remains is the infrastructure they built, running without the understanding that designed it. The users who depended on the specialists are now maintaining systems they can't fully explain.

    ### Stage 4: Reinvention

    New practitioners build understanding from the remnants — not by recovering the original knowledge, but by developing new approaches adapted to current conditions. The reinvention may be shallower than the original, or it may discover things the original specialists missed. It is always different.

    ### The Resonance System (system-scale)

    | Stage | Expression | Notes |
    |-------|-----------|-------|
    | Knowledge | Elven resonance science — deep understanding of all three bands across all bandwidths, including narrow | Ring-era engineering operated routinely at narrow bandwidth |
    | Overuse | Ring-era civilization depended entirely on resonance infrastructure without most inhabitants understanding it | The ring was "the backbone of everything" — total dependency |
    | Loss | The elves disappear during the Signal Famine, taking deep resonance knowledge with them | The knowledge gap is the system's most persistent vulnerability |
    | Reinvention | Tuners — folk and Clarisant practitioners who rebuilt resonance practice from fragments | Folk Tuning sometimes works better for local conditions than recovered theory would predict |

    **Status:** Complete cycle. The reinvention stage is ongoing — the Clarisant vs folk tension IS the reinvention playing out.

    ### The Synod's AI Communication (faction-scale)

    | Stage | Expression | Notes |
    |-------|-----------|-------|
    | Knowledge | Elven AI design — custodians built to process information across 18-dimensional frameworks | The original operators understood the math |
    | Overuse | Ring-era civilization relied on AI custodian oversight for governance and regulation | Total dependency on systems designed by elves |
    | Loss | The elves disappear; nobody remaining understands the AI's cognitive architecture | Threshold Station keeps running but nobody can explain why |
    | Reinvention | The Synod's ritual-based communication — trial-and-error sequences that produce reliable results without theoretical understanding | Engineering by superstition, and it works |

    **Status:** Complete cycle. The Synod's reinvention is fundamentally different from the original — they have results without theory, which is the inverse of the elves' position.

    ### The Bloom (catastrophe-scale)

    | Stage | Expression | Notes |
    |-------|-----------|-------|
    | Knowledge | Elven understanding of resonance ecology — the ring's systems were designed with ecological balance in mind | The ring functioned as an integrated system, not isolated components |
    | Overuse | Coremark's aggressive harvesting + Span replication experiments, enabled by cheap ringglass and low caution | Nobody studying resonance ecology because nobody thought it needed studying |
    | Loss | The knowledge was already lost (elven departure) — the overuse happened in the absence of understanding | The Bloom is the loss-then-overuse variant: knowledge lost first, then the system pushed past limits nobody knew existed |
    | Reinvention | Lira's Wall, the Displacement Council's containment operations, Bloom Zone study | The reinvention is ongoing and incomplete — containment is not restoration |

    **Status:** Cycle at stage 4 (reinvention in progress). The Bloom is the loop's most dramatic expression because the loss and overuse stages overlapped — the knowledge was gone before anyone realized the system needed protecting.

  prose <<~PROSE, section: :significance, heading: "What the Loop Produces"
    Each cycle produces knowledge that is different from what was lost. The Tuners don't have elven science — they have something new. The Synod doesn't communicate with AIs the way the elves did — they do something no one else can explain. The Displacement Council doesn't understand Bloom Zone ecology the way the ring builders did — they understand containment.

    These practitioners have adapted surviving systems to conditions the old accounts do not explain. They also teach apprentices, preserve successful methods and compare results. That continuing work can pass knowledge onward without another loss.
