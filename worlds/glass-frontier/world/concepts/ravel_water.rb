  prose <<~PROSE
    Six sealed trays hold the clear liquid called Ravel Water, recovered from two outer collector panels at #{ref :ravel, "Ravel"}. It remains fluid at temperatures that freeze ordinary water in the same room. Two samples brought together spread into one moving sheet and produce a cluster of high-band tones.

    The liquid carries dissolved mineral salts matching the plume and a chain of complex carbon compounds absent from earlier catches. A thin film climbs ceramic toward another sealed sample when the trays stand within a meter of each other. Metal and ringglass containers hold it in place.

    Separate pressure cells keep the samples more than a meter apart. One travels aboard *Nera Doss* during the next plume crossing, with temperature, pressure, distance, and signal tone recorded through the passage.

  gm_note :triggered_by, "The moment players stow two trays in the same locker or carry them down a corridor together, the films climb the ceramic toward one another and the high-band tones start, loud enough on any signal sounder to bring whoever is on watch."
  gm_note :complicates, "Only metal and ringglass hold the liquid in place, so in an ordinary galley or processing room it is already crossing the ceramic while the party improvises containment out of whatever the room happens to have."
