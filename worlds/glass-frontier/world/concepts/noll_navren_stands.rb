  prose <<~PROSE
    #{ref :noll, "Noll"} coppices its #{encyclopedia_ref :navren, "navren"} from named root stools. Cultivar plates stand beside the oldest survivors. Growers reserve stems for a declared load, shape them through successive cutting cycles, and mark every harvest with the stool, shade season, imposed load, and grower's hand.

    Those marks remain on the finished brace so later repairers can orient it as it grew. Noll supplies the curved frames used in Rib's doors and pressure passages, along with paired spars for kite frames that must flex across separate loads.

  gm_note :appears, "Every cut carries the stool, shade season, imposed load, and grower's hand, leaving a finished brace traceable to one stand at Noll."
  gm_note :triggered_by, "A request for an uncommon curve reserves a living stem and waits through its cutting cycles; dried stock cannot be retuned into the missing shape."
  gm_note :complicates, "A salvaged or stolen frame still carries the harvest marks that identify where it grew and who shaped it."
