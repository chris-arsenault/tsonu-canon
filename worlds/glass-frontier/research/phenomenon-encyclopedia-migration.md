# Phenomenon Encyclopedia Migration

Completed migration checkpoint, committed in `26ef4ae`. Counts, ids and
checks below describe that extraction. Later naming work changed Shuttered
Habs to The Shuttered (`shuttered`); the canonical sources own current names.

Five reusable phenomena remain Encyclopedia articles. Three named Atlas subjects retain the spatial or narrative particulars; Drawdown and Resonance have no Atlas target.

| Encyclopedia owner | Atlas disposition | Classification | Atlas connections retained or established |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drawdown | None | General field failure only | None |
| Echo Rivers | The Kaleidos Echo Rivers | `geographic_location`; `type_of :echo_rivers` | Part of Kaleidos; clearest branches in the Sable Crescent; caused by the Glassfall; studied by the Echo Ledger Conclave and Sora Meralis; used by Ledgerfall; embodied by Who Remembers |
| Glassfall Showers | The Spreading Front | `geographic_location`; `type_of :glassfall_showers` | Part of and manifests in the Shear; caused by the Glassfall; causes the Corridor Disputes; studied by Prismwell and the Lumenshard Conservatory; entered by Rainline; supports Three Arms Yard |
| Resonance | None | Universal physical phenomenon only | None |
| Shuttered Habs | Hab Coriolis | veiled `installation`; `type_of :shuttered_habs` | Regulated by the Tempered Accord; fills Reconnection's shock-of-difference beat; contains the Coriolis Breach |

Hab Coriolis remains a veiled named hook. The public Coriolis Breach incident owns the established account of forced entry; the installation does not duplicate it.

## Topology accounting

The reusable preflight at `build/glass-frontier/before-phenomena-review.json` records 59 named relations incident to the five old Atlas type nodes. It projects the raw removal before replacements or other approved categories. The file was captured before the resource and culture-role-practice changes landed, so its whole-world `--verify` result is not a single-category after-state comparison.

Of the old relations belonging to the three replaced phenomena, fifteen remain applicable after excluding links to the removed Hab-Worlder, Pre-Glassfall Transmissions, Stillwater, and Resonance type nodes. A tuple comparison against the final graph finds all fifteen with the same verb, endpoints under the approved old-to-new mapping, dates, and audience.

The final Atlas has 491 entities and 1,339 named relations. Its game-world projection has 486 entities, 1,358 typed edges, 1,347 non-bookkeeping edges, five connected components, and the same four isolated structural entries as the saved projection. All 86 Chronicle locations have at least ten one-hop focus choices.

The final entity delta from the 502-entity technology baseline is eleven: eight resources were replaced one for one, nine cultures, roles, and practices left the Atlas without replacements, and five phenomena became three named Atlas subjects. Drawdown and Resonance account for the two phenomenon removals without replacements.

Seventeen additional Atlas relationships type claims already present in existing prose so the removal of reusable type hubs does not erase named scene choices. They connect Deep Shear to the Pell Freight Assembly and Echo Ledger Conclave; Fermata, Kesh, Mera, Ledgerfall, the Sable Crescent, Sithari, and Three Arms Yard to existing Glassfall evidence; Ladderwell to the Counterweight road rig; Ledgerfall and the Sable Crescent to evidence of the elven disappearance; Lumenshard to Prismwell flights; Lung Three to Merren's active trial; Sithari to the Echo Ledger Conclave and Tessellan Communion; and Thornvault to the original Answering Strip held there.

No Atlas prose reference or graph relationship targets `drawdown`, `echo_rivers`, `glassfall_showers`, `resonance`, or `shuttered_habs`. The only Atlas declarations using those identifiers are the three explicit `type_of` attributes above.
