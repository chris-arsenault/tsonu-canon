# Encyclopedia placement plan

Completed planning record from plan `adce063e` (2026-08-30), reconciled
2026-09-21. Its later phases completed availability, location retagging,
authoring and matcher checks; plan `53a5155e` completed the remaining
90-entry authoring pool. The matrices, old ids and predicate proposals below
are historical measurements, not a current work list. Use `reference list`
and availability queries for the current corpus.

## Flora follow-through — 2026-09-21

The separate flora phase of taxonomy plan `24fd07f5` is complete. A source
read of every current plant, tree and lichen article found eleven complete
public entries, including authored cultivation, material uses and named
locations. Fungi, animals and mixed ecological groups are excluded from this
count so the evidence does not depend on fauna totals.

| Prevalence | Entries | Coverage read |
|---|---|---|
| Common | Navren, Sureni, Thesset, Ulessa, Velori | Coppiced structural timber, tidal root beds, fruit climbers, resin-bearing trees and hab crops. |
| Uncommon | Issava, Merai, Nethri, Resonance Lichen, Signal Mat | Warmth-sensitive climbers, musical reeds, Lithren's mobile plant colonies, strike-warning lichen and hull-seam growth. |
| Rare | Akhul | Hydraulic canopy plants cultivated around Iridess and Tereval, with usable support nodules. |

The field and texture expansions supplied later flora independently of the
original pool. This closes the separate coverage obligation; semantic Atlas
rebalancing and the six-hab review remain open on their own terms.

## Original placement measurements

## Matrix 1 — kind × prevalence, complete entries only

Target inherited from the ten-kind plan: 10 common / 10 uncommon / 5 rare per
kind. Shells and drafts count nowhere.

| kind | common | uncommon | rare | complete | authored (drafts incl.) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ability | 0 | 1 | 10 | 11 | 37 |
| culture | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 33 |
| lifeform | 9 | 7 | 0 | 16 | 39 |
| phenomenon | 2 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 21 |
| resource | 3 | 2 | 3 | 8 | 19 |
| role | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 3 |
| technology | 11 | 1 | 2 | 14 | 20 |

Only technology meets any single quota. Every complete ability is rare — the
everyday tier of the spellbook is entirely draft. The target itself needs a
decision at seven kinds; see the plan.

## Matrix 2 — kind × placement tag, authored entries

After the phase 7 rename, selectors use only the four base properties
(surface, orbital, outer_system, sealed_hab). No entry yet selects any of the
17 new tags. The projection below is what the corpus looks like after phase 10
applies the predicate plan in the next section.

Projected selecting-entry counts per tag (all kinds):
debris_field ~20, garden ~12, dock ~11, waterway ~10, yard ~9, hot ~8,
road ~8, damaged_signal ~7, ringglass_rich ~7, cold ~5, displacement_zone ~5,
bloom_adjacent ~4, archive ~4, cordon ~4, **urban ~2, unstable_route ~2,
market ~2**.

Thin cells (bold) are the phase 11 authoring targets alongside the prevalence
deficits: urban texture (only gutter crowns and the drain migration), unstable
routes (only Avar material), and market texture (only tally dust and the
Thirty-One echo).

## Predicate plan — phase 10 work list

For each non-global authored entry, the availability it should declare after
generalization. `+` means and (`all`), `/` means or (`any`), `!` means not
(`none`). Base realm terms are kept only where they still carry meaning.
Powers, law bodies, sapient species, and roles not listed here go
`available_globally` (participant scope is a later, game-side concern).
